never winter night or icewind dale 2s engine, 
different by 
	the use of morrowind proggression
		this regards every action you prefform during the course of a lvl
			if you only swing 1handed blades during the whole turn of one lvl, 
				you will only increase in onhanded fighting as many points as your class allows, that is fighter 1 star per lvl and other classes only every second lvl
				same goes with healing, bardsinging, spellcasting, choise scools of spells casted
		this could also apply to witch class you will multiclass with, if at all
			a cleric only using ofensive magic might multiclass with wizard
			while a ranger using spellcasting and animal empaty frequently can transend into druidhood
			a question stays though, wouldn't that weeken the character rather than strenghten it, if it keep diverting from it's mainclass 
				i think this is solved in say neverwitner where certain requirements met allows the char to unlock kits
				though, one way could be that even if you say gain a lvl in wizardclass when you are ranger lvl 5
				still counts as if you just lvled as ranger but you gain the possibility to learn arcane scrolls, you do not gain as much health per lvl maybe
			number of spellslotts is a problem, i don't think it makes sens to divide it as much as in icewind dale2 and onwards
				i'd say that the number of spells memorizeable should alaways be as if you where of a spellcaster with same int or wit as you
					and or by some formula like spellcaster stat = f(int,wis,char)(the interesting question is how many points you have spent on spellrelated)
					
				
		
	kits and multiclasses like bg2
		npcs are more restricted than human char
		minsc can't not pick ranger or fighter as class
		edin canot choose but possible other wizard specialities
		sarevok can't pick other than clerk and fighter/blackguard
		jaheria can't pick other than fighter druid and later kits
		etc etc
