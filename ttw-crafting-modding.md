# Ttw crafting modding

It's is very important to learn modern scripting practice

* Replace all workbenches with modular ones
* coffee brewers is small boiling crafting benches
* crafting benches should be diversified
* recepies should be spread over a larger number of benches
* Chemistryset is appropriate for poisons, and chems mainly
* Extract components from more complex chems

* Hootch conversion, 
   When using ttw we'd not need a new asset for purified spirits, as hotch is basically crudely distilled spirits and perfect for the purpose.

Flamer fuel from hootch, and.... Paper?
     Paper is everywhere but maybe not suitable anyway.
     I'm thinking rubber.... Or a plant of some sort, but that hardly common enough.
     We could use plastics from does lose objects into breakable objects.

I don't dislike the premise of fallout four crafting.
But its sad you can't utelise some of the more integrate objects like a steam gauge feels perfect for a flamethrower or powerglowe or syringe gun and wouldn't need to be broken down into components first.

# Ttw total conversion

* War of the commonwealth
* auto loot ( maybe just corpses )
* Linked storage or bank
* Armour quickly degrading
* smarter ai
* burn

Some sort of insentive to explore inside buildings and a increased danger doing so, for example, spawn mainly ghouls in exteriors while raiders spawn in interiors.

Something like, any time entering a cell, set spawn timer, set spawn list, and ignore more global approaches that might be more resources consuming.

Maybe armoured ghouls is a more suitable actor, and then let towns be fortified safe heavens.
