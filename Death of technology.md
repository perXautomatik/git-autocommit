wrong this is not what we do this should not be done it is a bad way to use the
 
computer don't do it but then why would you anyway what would motivate someone
 
to do this to put this much effort and risk into a feature this dumb cuz let's be real here this is useless what's it
 
getting you an extra 10 seconds to look at your calendar you can barely read it in time I mean you would have to pause
 
the boot process and at that point just let it finish and use Outlook and okay
 
if Outlook was taking 20 seconds to load then they could have just bundled a 256 kilobyte application that reads those

whether they could to ask if they should they showed it to their bosses they said cool ship it and that's the end of the
 
story but that one's boring and I don't think it's very likely to be honest inside a juggernaut like HP so instead
 
here's some cynicism you can skip it if you like I won't mind there's nothing here to feel good about I have a thesis
 
that I voiced before in various forms that technology as we know it is a phenomenon that happened once upon a

overwhelming proportion of problems as far as consumer products go are solved not everyone can afford those Solutions
 
and many solutions won't get made because they aren't sufficiently profitable these are not in dispute I'm not saying there's nothing left for us
 
to do as a species I'm saying that we're never going to see another Walkman a device so deeply altering what you can
 
do in your day-to-day life that stores can't keep it on the shelves I believe that our culture is so deeply formed

: 
The text expresses skepticism about the value of a particular computer feature, questioning the effort put into something perceived as trivial. It suggests that the feature, which allows a user to view their calendar during the boot process, offers no real benefit since it saves only a few seconds. The author proposes two theories for its existence: one, an engineer was excited about the potential of UEFI and pushed the feature without considering its practicality; two, a more cynical view that reflects on the state of technology, positing that most significant inventions have already been made and consumer technology has reached a plateau. The author believes we will not see groundbreaking devices like the Walkman again because the culture is too focused on consumer technology, leaving us uncertain about the future when there are no new gadgets to drive consumer interest. The summary concludes with a reflection on the cycle of invention and market saturation, using the example of a vacuum cleaner to illustrate the point.

Copilot

The cynical view presented in the text is that technological innovation, particularly in consumer products, has reached a plateau. The author suggests that the era of groundbreaking inventions that fundamentally change our daily lives is over. Most of the problems that technology aimed to solve for consumers have been addressed, and the solutions are well-established. The market is no longer driven by the need for new technologies but rather by the desire to maintain consumer interest and corporate profits.

This perspective implies that companies are now inventing problems to solve or creating marginal improvements on existing products to give the illusion of progress. It’s a cycle fueled by the necessity to sell new products and generate profit, rather than genuine innovation. The author posits that our culture has become so intertwined with consumer technology that we may find ourselves at a loss when there are no new gadgets to capture our attention.

The text also touches on the idea that not all technological solutions are pursued because they may not be profitable enough, despite their potential benefits. This leads to a situation where technological advancement is dictated not by what is possible or what could improve lives, but by what is profitable.

In summary, the cynical view is that the golden age of technology has passed, and we are now in an era of technological stagnation, where the drive for profit has overtaken the drive for innovation, leading to a culture unsure of its direction without the constant introduction of new consumer technologies.

then convince a bunch of people hopefully everyone that a vacuum cleaner will make them happy you now make a lot
 ---
of profit by selling vacuum cleaners oops Market saturation everyone has a
 
vacuum nobody needs a new one they work for a long time and even when they break 's now 30 companies selling equivalent
 
cleaners so why would someone buy another one of yours well to solve this problem you invent a new vacuum with a
 
stronger motor or a quieter motor a bigger hose a better beater less weight Etc you tell everyone the new vacuum
 
cleaner will make them happy again and if you're lucky they all buy yours and not someone else's bam you make a lot of
 
profit well what happens when the perfect vacuum cleaner is discovered the whole theory of capitalism centers
 
around the idea of continuous Improvement but I argue that this has actually happened that vacuums got as
 
good as they could conceivably get decades ago and nobody has any idea how to compete anymore so they're all losing
 
their minds it's reached the point where you can't buy a good vacuum cleaner anymore because they're all so deeply
 
entrenched in the drive to compete in a space where competition is logically impossible that they've trended away
 
from the solved problems this gets worse when you consider the perspective of a company like HP even 20 years ago what
 
did their job look like okay you assemble a thing out of parts that you had nothing to do with an Intel CPU and
 
chipset real Tech audio Nvidia GPU Western Digital hard drive then you convince people that your machine is
 
what the cheapest the most reliable question marks and then
 
hopefully you make profit by selling the exact same thing that your competition does yeah it's it's broken the whole
 
latter part of the loop is missing how does HP convince you that their machine is better when it can't be
 
because HP doesn't make anything they can't make anything their product is metal boxes plastic trim and
 
motherboards everything else they sell is a jelly bean a part that some other company made that all other vendors also
 
have access to CPUs chipsets hard drives LCD screens these all do specific things
 
that need to work exactly the way they all already do nobody wants a round LCD
 
so every screen is identical except in matters of degree resolution brightness color quality size dot pitch Etc but
 
there are no local Maxima possible we know what the best screen for a business
 
machine is and the only difference between a given HP and a given Dell is whether they did or didn't choose the
 
objectively correct part if you buy the machine with the 1366 X 768 display you
 
got something that is simply worse than it could have been the only stuff that HP has editorial input on are the metal
 
boxes the plastic trim and there's really not that much much you can do with those and motherboards are even
 
worse they have to be exactly the same in every machine in existence because they're just plugging together Jelly
 
Bean parts and then it has to run someone else's software so the firmware has to be 100% functionally identical to
 
every other machine this is why motherboard seos setups got those wacky graphical backgrounds and inscrutable
 
controls because it was literally the only thing they were able to make their own so they poured all the mustard they
 
had on it because what else can you do when you're otherwise invisible like at
 
least with laptops they could do stuff with the case right like the elite books have this little pop out LED here that
 
illuminates the keyboard it's absolutely adorable it's delightful and uh IBM had them in like 1999 CU it's a really
 
obvious idea it's like one of the most obvious ideas possible and it's yet another Jelly Bean Part hey you know
 
what else we have white LEDs put those in there somewhere so what's next after
 
that what do you what do you add cuz cuz most people don't really want anything more 

: The text critiques the notion of continuous improvement in capitalism using the example of vacuum cleaners. It suggests that once a market reaches saturation, where everyone has a product that works well and lasts long, companies struggle to sell more. They attempt to innovate with features like stronger motors or lighter designs, but eventually, products reach an optimal state where further improvements are unnecessary or unnoticeable.

The author argues that this has happened with vacuum cleaners—they’ve become as good as they can get, and companies are now “losing their minds” trying to compete in a market where competition is “logically impossible.” This problem is likened to the PC industry, where companies like HP assemble computers from parts made by other companies, making it hard to differentiate their products. Since all PCs need to perform specific functions and run the same software, there’s little room for meaningful innovation. The only areas where companies can make their mark are on superficial aspects like the design of the case or motherboard firmware interfaces.

The summary concludes that in a market where the core product (like a PC) has reached its peak development, companies are left to focus on minor and often unnecessary features to appear different, even though these features do not significantly enhance the user’s experience.



than a mouse a keyboard a set of speakers and a monitor and everything
 
already has those and they're all very good already if HP could think of something new to add it would just be
 
something you could plug in with USB or Thunderbolt and virtually everything that you can imagine of that sort is
 
already being sold basically the only problems left to solve with the entire category of PCS is minor aspects of
 
convenience how many ports where they are whether they're on the back or the side Etc so
 
imagine being a product designer at HP in the very late 2000s some VP storms in and goes we have to deliver features for
 
executives we're selling them $2,500 notebooks but Dells have all the same ins and outs we need
 
features what do you do well there's only one thing you can do you stare at the guy and you muster up the courage to
 ----
say Bob we're a motherboard we're a turnkey we're in the middle we don't get
 
to have features our business is selling invisible unnoticeable plinths whose so
 
purpose is to hold up a copy of Microsoft Office and that's the truth the trouble is it's not what Bob wants
 
to hear because he wants a bonus he got hired for a sefian job and he's realizing this he will never be in
 
charge of an important headline feature because there won't ever be one he works for a company that makes widgets Bob is
 
in hell and he's making it your problem so he tells you you're fired and then he turns to the next person and he says the
 
same thing and fires him if need be and he repeats until someone blurts out the dumbest idea they've ever had in a cold
 
panic because Executives run Outlook that's their job the job of a CEO is to
 
send emails and Outlook is how you do that at a job so you can't sell Executives anything I mean what are you
 
going to offer them more RAM Outlook runs fine in four gigs even now and especially then more CPU same answer
 
Outlook runs on a core2 Duo a GPU for what to render graphs there's nothing to
 
sell to a person who could still do their job on a computer from 2004 so
 
when you blurred out uh what if we made Outlook start faster Bob's going to go there you go do that it's it's the
 
poochie episode from The Simpsons it's always been like this but how do you make Outlook faster I mean you can't
 
it's impossible Microsoft controls the whole machine let alone Outlook HP can't stick their fingers in and somehow
 
enhance that experience so they touch the only thing they actually have domain over the pre-boot experience up until
 
when Windows starts HP is still in control their firmware is still executing that's the only crack they
 
could get their fingers into and they were starving does it make sense to write a whole Bare Metal application
 
that runs Raw on the CPU just so an executive doesn't have to wait an extra 10 seconds to read their email of course
 
not they're not going to use it okay they're just going to boot into windows they're going to ignore that button
 
entirely but HP needs a feature because Bob needs a feature so they make one of
 
the only standalone fi applications in history so that department can say that they shipped
 
something and then they're out of ideas we made quasy Outlook it loads in 8 seconds and 6 months later ah Bob
 
needs another bonus we got to do something well um uh well okay we can't make Windows
 
boot faster but can can we run code while it's booting no well we're
 
all out of a job then so someone figure it out and so they did it's the only lever they could pull there were no
 
others so they pulled that one what else do you do when your job your industry has been obsolete for years I mean don't
 
get me wrong there are good Engineers doing good engineering at HP okay maybe you work there designing motherboards
 
terrific someone has to figure out how to plug together the jelly beans it's a hard job but at the end of the day it's
 
the same thing everybody else is doing it's no different than the car industry Hyundai Dodge Honda Toyota they're all
 
employing skilled Engineers to do real work but they're all working on the same problems and they're going to solve them
 
to about the same level of satisfaction except where they've been denied access to the known ideal Solutions due to
 
economics or IP law it's duplicated effort on a good day we don't need dozens of car manufacturers we know how
 
to make good engines sturdy frames and comfortable Upholstery and every company is within a few points of each other
 
except where they're egregiously doing a bad job solely because Bob needs a bonus and can only achieve that by shaking up
 
something that was already fine the way it was middle management has a vested interest in

:
The text is a critical reflection on the PC industry, particularly focusing on the lack of meaningful innovation and the redundancy of efforts among companies. It portrays a hypothetical scenario where an employee named Bob, representing middle management, is desperate for a feature to justify his position and earn a bonus. The narrative suggests that companies like HP are stuck in a cycle of creating unnecessary features, such as a standalone application to make Outlook start faster, because they cannot innovate in significant ways due to Microsoft’s control over the operating system and the mature state of PC technology.

The author compares the PC industry to the car industry, where many engineers work on the same problems with only marginal differences in the final product, often restricted by economic and intellectual property constraints. The summary implies that the industry has reached a point where most consumer needs have been met, and further developments are driven more by the need for corporate profit and managerial bonuses than by genuine advancements in technology. The text concludes with a sense of frustration over the stagnation and perceived obsolescence within the industry.

Certainly! The text delves into the challenges faced by the PC industry, particularly from the perspective of a company like HP, which is caught in a market that has reached technological maturity. Here’s a more detailed elaboration:

1. **Industry Saturation**: The author suggests that the PC industry has reached a saturation point where significant innovation is no longer possible. The market is filled with products that are good enough for most users, making it difficult for companies to introduce features that genuinely stand out.
    
2. **Innovation Dilemma**: The real innovation, according to the text, comes from the manufacturers of the core components, like silicon. However, even these manufacturers are struggling with the reality that they have far exceeded the market’s demand, and the average consumer does not require frequent upgrades.
    
3. **Technological Plateau**: The author points out that the technological advancements in PCs have plateaued. Computers from several years ago are still sufficient for most tasks today, indicating that the pace of meaningful improvements has slowed down.
    
4. **Economic Waste**: The text criticizes the economic inefficiency in the PC industry, where high-quality computers are discarded or end up in landfills because it is not profitable to redistribute them to those who could use them.
    
5. **Redundant Efforts**: The author compares the PC industry to the car industry, where many companies solve the same problems with only slight variations in the final product. This redundancy is often due to economic constraints or intellectual property laws.
    
6. **Corporate Desperation**: The narrative introduces a character named Bob, a middle manager desperate for a feature to justify his role and earn a bonus. This desperation leads to the creation of unnecessary features, such as a standalone application to make Outlook start faster, despite it being unlikely to be used.
    
7. **Pre-Boot Experience**: The text explains that since companies like HP cannot modify the Windows operating system, they focus on the pre-boot experience, which is the only area they have control over before Windows starts.
    
8. **Questioning the Future**: The author questions what decisions corporations will make as they come to terms with the industry’s stagnation. There is a sense of concern about the future strategies of these companies and whether they will continue to pursue superficial features.
    
9. **Engineering Challenges**: Despite the industry’s challenges, the author acknowledges that there are good engineers at HP who are doing important work. However, the work is not fundamentally different from what others in the industry are doing.
    

In essence, the text is a contemplation on the state of the PC industry, highlighting the lack of substantial innovation, the redundancy of efforts, and the economic and managerial pressures that drive companies to pursue unnecessary features. It paints a picture of an industry that has outpaced the needs of its consumers and is now grappling with its own success.

The text reflects on the state of the PC industry, suggesting that companies have been cutting corners to stay competitive in a market that has reached saturation. Innovation is seen as limited to silicon manufacturers, while the need for new computers has diminished due to technological stagnation. The author notes that computers from 2016 remain adequate for most users today, and many high-quality computers are discarded due to economic inefficiency. The text criticizes the industry’s overproduction, likening it to putting excessively powerful engines in golf carts. It questions the future decisions of corporations in light of this reality and recalls a time around 2010 when technological advancements like UEFI, PCI Express, and USB 3 made significant impacts, contrasting it with the current lack of progress. The author also mentions an outdated HP feature that seemed out of place in 2010 but was actually from 2007, suggesting that HP might have continued it out of inertia. The summary concludes with the author expressing uncertainty about the role of product designers in an industry that has surpassed the needs of most consumers.

can you eleaborate the text a little bit

Copilot

Certainly! The text is a commentary on the current state of the personal computer (PC) industry, highlighting several key points:

1. **Market Saturation**: The author believes that the PC market has reached a point where further competition is futile because the demand for new computers has plateaued. Manufacturers are struggling to find ways to innovate and differentiate their products in a market that is already oversupplied.
    
2. **Lack of Innovation**: The text suggests that true innovation in the PC industry is rare and mostly comes from those who create the silicon—the fundamental component of computers. However, even these manufacturers are facing the reality that the market is oversaturated, and most consumers no longer see the need to upgrade their computers frequently.
    
3. **Technological Stagnation**: The author observes that there has been little noticeable improvement in PC performance over the years. Computers from 2016 are still adequate for most users’ needs today, indicating that the pace of technological advancement has slowed significantly.
    
4. **Economic Inefficiency**: The commentary criticizes the economic model of the PC industry, where perfectly functional computers end up in landfills simply because it is not profitable to redistribute them to people who could use them.
    
5. **Overproduction**: The industry is described as having gone beyond what most people need, with the analogy of putting overly powerful engines in golf carts. This overproduction is seen as wasteful and unnecessary.
    
6. **Corporate Myopia**: The author questions why corporations have not recognized this trend and what desperate measures they might take once they come to terms with this “inevitable truth.” The mention of HP (Hewlett-Packard) suggests that companies have previously made rash decisions when faced with similar market conditions.
    
7. **Historical Context**: The text reminisces about a more exciting time in PC history around 2010 when significant technological shifts, such as the transition to UEFI, PCI Express, and USB 3, made substantial differences in computer capabilities. This contrasts with the current lack of meaningful advancements.
    
8. **Future Outlook**: The author expresses concern about the future of the PC industry, anticipating that companies may engage in “bizarre flailing” as they struggle to adapt to the new market realities.
    

In summary, the text is a reflective piece on the PC industry’s challenges, questioning the sustainability of current practices and the direction in which the industry is headed. The author’s tone suggests a mix of nostalgia for past innovations and apprehension about the future.

The comment thread discusses the trend of technology companies integrating AI into their products. The consensus among the commenters is that AI is being used as a marketing tool to add novelty to products in a market that has reached saturation. There’s a sense that AI features could run on older devices, but they’re made exclusive to new models to drive sales. Commenters express frustration over the lack of meaningful innovation, with smartphones being “done” and only receiving superficial updates. There’s a call for standardization and sustainability in technology, rather than the constant push for new features that aren’t necessary. Some users reminisce about older phones that still meet their needs and criticize the industry for not focusing on real improvements, like bringing back the headphone jack or removable batteries. The thread reflects a growing consumer awareness of and disillusionment with the perceived artificiality of the tech industry’s push for AI.

The comment thread is a discussion among users about the current state of technological innovation, particularly focusing on the integration of AI into products. The users share a sentiment that AI has become the latest feature that companies add to their products to create a sense of novelty and to differentiate themselves in a saturated market.

One user, @klikini, suggests that AI is the only thing left for companies to add to their products. This comment receives a significant number of likes, indicating agreement from other users. Another user, @CathodeRayDude, almost included a screenshot of an article stating that AI is being pushed because the latest Windows update did not lead to a significant number of people upgrading their systems.

@St0rmcrash adds that while the public may be impressed by AI, especially with chatbots, the real push for AI comes from companies searching for the “next big thing.” They compare this to Samsung’s marketing in the early 2010s, where the company was desperate to find a feature that would make their phones seem superior to the iPhone.

@thany3 criticizes phone manufacturers for pushing new models with AI features that could run on older phones but are instead made exclusive to the latest models. They lament that smartphones have reached a point where they are “done,” and any phone up to 5 years old still functions well, except for the lack of updates.

@gydo1942 echoes this sentiment, mentioning that their 6-year-old phone still meets their needs. They question whether AI features are truly necessary, comparing it to the trend of adding IoT and internet connectivity to everything a few years ago.

@hiroantag suggests that in an ideal world, technology would focus on standardization, sustainability, and replaceability, rather than competition and consumerism, which they believe worsens our experience.

@tech34756 speculates that Samsung’s AI might be backported when sales slow down or if they start charging for the AI service, drawing a parallel to Siri and server hacks that allowed it to run on older iPhones.

@renakunisaki points out that there are still issues to fix in modern phones, such as the missing headphone jack and nonremovable battery, which were features that existed in the past.

@michaelangeloabarreto4588 criticizes the Galaxy S24 presentation for focusing on AI features developed by Google, without mentioning hardware improvements.

@BITBOARD_DEV expresses disbelief at the current state of technology with a series of ellipses.

@Maadinsh shares that they could still use their Nexus 5 from 2013 for their current needs, highlighting the backward incompatibility of software updates as a reason for needing to upgrade.

@amyshaw893 mentions working at a company that tried to integrate AI into their product without a clear benefit, suggesting that it was done just for the sake of adding AI.

Overall, the thread reflects a broader conversation about the direction of technological progress, with many users feeling that the industry is pushing AI as a gimmick rather than focusing on meaningful innovation or addressing real consumer needs. There’s a call for a shift towards more sustainable and consumer-friendly practices in technology development.
