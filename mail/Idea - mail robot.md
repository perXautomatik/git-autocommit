scans and or slize what ever arrived in the post
needs ai to validate what mailbox filling is scannable,
could be almost enough with a function to take a photo of what arrived in the mail and send the picture as an email or to softwear.
some problems
mail doesn’t arrive as a4 straight papers,
robotic control required to help the machinne handle the object in place ffor scanning, taking a bill out of an envelope or simply unfold ot straighten a paper ffor scanning
if an object to different from what expected arrived, maybe just a photo.
stooring recived scanned or just waiting for walidation mail, need to be put somewhere, maybe in a shelf beside of door,
if command is given to destroy object it could fetch it from the shelf and slize it to save space.
if command is given to eject object; it could eather take it out of the shelf or simply tell wich slot it is in.
lots of sensors will be needed regarding the handling of objects, for the sake of being sure the handling arms is actually carrying something etc.


background.


the idea was triggered due me hating opening reading and sorting my letters and bills when it could be sent ass emails, therefore automatik digitalizer could be usefull, attached to once mailbox.
