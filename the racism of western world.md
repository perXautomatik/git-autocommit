0:00

and gazer is a stress test and what it's shown is a

0:05

West that is racist however you want to define the turn the point is what was occurring to

0:12

the Gins occur to you was inflicted on any Europeans you

0:17

wouldn't get this not just plaz response but this complicity we are in legal

0:24

terms you know accomplishes before during the fact

0:31

[Music]

0:38

hello everybody this is Pascal from neutrality studies and today I've got with me again Michael brener Michael is

0:45

a professor emeritus of international Affairs at the University of Pittsburgh and a fellow at the center for transatlantic relations at John Hopkins

0:52

he recently published an essay entitled The wests Reckoning the link is below in

0:59

which he argues that the two defeats the one in milit the military defeat of the

1:05

West in Ukraine and the moral defeat of the West in Gaza will have devastating consequences for the collective West uh

1:12

we want to discuss this today so thank you Michael for coming online again it's a pleasure to be to be with you Pascal

1:19

once again I look forward to it so I really loved your piece I just enjoyed

1:25

reading it and I would like to discuss it so um let me read the the introdu

1:30

paragraph because I think it's very powerful Western leaders are

1:36

experiencing two stunning events defeat in Ukraine and genocide in Palestine the

1:41

first is humiliating the other shameful yet they feel no humiliation or shame

1:46

their actions show vividly that those sentiments are alien to them unable to penetrate the entrenched barriers of

1:53

Dogma arrogance and deep seated insecurities the last are personal as as

2:00

well as political therein lies a puzzle for as a consequence the West has set

2:06

itself on a path of collective suicide moral suicide in Gaza diplomatic suicide

2:12

the foundations laid in Europe the Middle East and across Eurasia economic suicide the dollar-based Global

2:18

Financial system jeopardized Europe deindustrializing it's not a pretty

2:24

picture astoundingly this self-destruction is occurring in the absence of any major trauma external or

2:31

internal there in lies a related puzzle let's talk about the first puzzle first

2:38

um why has the West set itself on this path of collective

2:45

suicide that of course excuse me that of course is the the big question and as I

2:51

said the most puzzling question because I think any sort of standard

2:57

explanations which are rooted which would be rooted in our historical

3:03

experience um simply are are not sufficient if and if indeed they're

3:09

they're adequate adequate at all uh I think um it's impossible to

3:17

understand I think this phenomenon unless we place it in the context of

3:24

some rather unfortunate developments in the public life of West

3:30

societies generally which manifest themselves in a degrading of political

3:38

life public debate of values and Norms which are the foundation stones of a

3:45

healthy healthy poity I think the two words that best uh characterize it even

3:54

though those words themselves are are are are somewhat abstract is uh

4:01

neoism and narcissism neoism in the sense refers to a condition really a

4:07

state of State of Affairs in which uh all

4:12

institutionalized sort of authority and tradition and the sort of fundamental

4:20

norms and values of a society cease to

4:26

exercise their their influence as an affect a collective sort of super ego on

4:33

the behavior of of persons both at the very top uh the people who are our

4:40

masters the people who hold the great offices of state and in fact I would

4:46

argue it's it's visible as well in the let's say the abuse of authority by

4:53

those who hold positions of power and influence uh in all inst institutions be

5:00

the economic be they uh Financial whether they be social once SE

5:06

it even even in in in universities as as a consequence I mean

5:12

there is no insufficient break or sort of check on Persons inclined to act in

5:22

in a manner that is impelled by by Emotion by

5:28

Dogma uh by willful ignorance and I think those are the

5:34

three traits which characterize sort of not just leadership in the west today

5:41

but which characterize the political class as well and that's what permits

5:48

this sort of EX really rather extraordinary and probably singular

5:53

unprecedented uh Conformity that you see it's not just that certain leaders in

5:59

certain States seem to be disengaged from

6:04

reality uh pursuing taking actions that are self-contradictory

6:10

pursuing policies that are self-defeating it's not just individual leaders it indeed as the political Elite

6:17

and that political Elite uh encompasses uh officials elected and

6:24

appointed it encompasses the mainstream media

6:30

it Con it encompasses even the largest segment of of

6:37

Academia and and certainly if we're speaking of the United States this sort of constellation of think tanks and an

6:46

Institute which have such a a prominent influence in

6:52

shaping the educated public understanding as to how the world works

6:59

uh what's going on in it and how how we should address it those are ingredients

7:05

of what I think is is a totally unsort of precedented phenomenon which we're going

7:11

to be struggling to understand the sad thing is that we don't while we struggle

7:18

to understand it uh the West is inflicting on itself you know

7:24

wounds that I believe and I think objectively speaking um are extremely

7:31

serious and it's not at all clear uh how they are going to be dealt with whether

7:40

they will ever heal and whether the the kinds of of remedial actions necessary

7:48

to restore them to hell are even contemplated much less

7:54

applied where do you think that comes from because I I I share this View and you know

8:00

I think it's important for us to recognize that we are in the same epistemic bubble we we understand what's

8:05

going on in Ukraine in Gaza in the same in the same terms we have the same underlying analysis um you know good old

8:13

realism and I think we both agree with mimer we agree with Petra we agree with

8:19

others who have who who've had who have a certain understanding of what's Happening Now The Other Side the people

8:24

who do this Collective suicide either no they don't share they don't share that analysis they don't

8:30

they are not in our epistemic bubble they are in a different epistemic bubble

8:35

um because I don't think they lie when they when they

8:41

say certain things are clearly lies but when they when they say things like you know we must not let Russia win and we

8:47

must uh we must stand with Ukraine and you know especially the the the the empty stuff the stand with Ukraine or

8:53

the uh right of self-defense of Israel and so on these are empty empty shells

8:59

uh but they throw that out and I do I do think that these a lot of the people believe in them um some might be lying

9:06

others others have swallowed the pill hole um how's that how do you think that

9:12

happened because I do remember I there was a time I've read about a time when

9:18

Western Europe was more pragmatic and realist you know when the Germans did OST politic and tried to get along with

9:24

the Russians when when world leaders were actually engaging in the oso process in order to get to a two-state

9:30

solution and you know when that seems this seems to be gone so how did how did

9:37

we get here well I think we must begin by

9:42

looking at the United States because it's been some time in which the major

9:48

and certainly the minor or sort of smaller countries of Europe have

9:53

exercised the you know their full sovereignty in thinking through sort of

9:59

soberly where the national interests lie whether they align completely with the

10:06

self-defined national interest of the United States and whether they accept

10:12

responsibility for uh at times deviating from the American View and uh therefore

10:20

are prepared to accept an element of contention in transatlantic or or or

10:27

bilateral us some you know country X in Europe relations I mean the truth is

10:35

that after 70 75 or what we 79 years after the end of end of World War II we

10:42

are still I think living temperamentally and emotionally in the

10:47

postwar era in so far Europe is unnaturally uh dependent on the United

10:54

States not as much frankly for its security and defense because object ly speaking there is no manifest Le sort a

11:03

threat to Europe all this talk of Putin wanting to wash his boots in the English

11:09

Channel is pure nonsense it's confected right there's not an aoda of evidence to

11:17

to substantiate it but rather I think we have to look at it in psychological

11:22

terms it's the classic dependency relationship uh in which the United

11:28

States is the sort of superior sort of party and the Europeans are the

11:35

subordinate and willingly subordinate which Bears them the the

11:41

need the responsibility the pain to sort of think through these matters of

11:48

consequence and to conduct uh you know their own external relations diplomacy

11:56

with with the world the fascinating question is why this

12:03

psychology of dominance and subordination is has remained so

12:09

pervasive right uh long past the time

12:15

when events U constructed it or allowed it to

12:22

to develop and so Europe has become in far as the international stage is

12:27

concerned has become ically denatured um I'm not I

12:34

follow English British French Affairs less less

12:40

conscientiously uh other Continental European Affairs but this is self-evident has been evident for quite

12:47

some time so I think to in order to understand this sort of Conformity and

12:52

uniformity of Outlook and an Outlook which is disengaged from objective

12:59

reality uh you know having covering not only the United manifest not only in the

13:05

United States but throughout the West you have to note

13:13

this dependency relation this dominant subordinate relationship and therefore you look at what's happened in the

13:19

United States which the dominant part Which shapes thinking and even and emotions you know across across the West

13:28

so so with the source of this in a way and uh let me just sort of brief very

13:34

briefly note I think the currents that have come together uh let's not go too far back in

13:43

history let's just go back to 1991 one often speaks about American

13:49

triumphalism well yes that's true but there were no great public celebrations

13:55

there were no Victory parades what the collapse of the Soviet

14:00

Union did was something to confirm in in the collective American

14:05

subconscious the notion that the US is a privileged Society a country placed on

14:13

Earth whether by history or by Providence to lead the world towards a

14:19

more enlightened better future in other words we were born in a condition of orig original virtue and the Messianic

14:27

the belief in messianism right that this is that this is the way to do it and everybody needs we just need to spread

14:33

the good word of it well there too much two versions of this or two lines of of

14:41

dealing with the world that have contended with each other or at least did through much of our history and

14:48

that's that turns on the question of whether the United States fills its

14:53

Destiny as model or as agent and this was a great debate throughout the 19th

15:00

century and and there were those who who uh commented on it quite directly

15:06

like John Quincy Adams who wrote a famous passage remarks that with the

15:13

well wishes of you know to the forces of good in the world but we were're not

15:19

there to pick up arms Bo of course yeah we America won't search uh what was it

15:27

America won't go in search of its of ERS abroad very good I forgotten the exact

15:33

words right that began to change as the United States one grew stronger became

15:39

the dominant industrial power when early in the 19th century of course the the

15:46

first signs were well the Manifest Destiny is one of the um

15:55

one of the consequences or one of the manifestations of this attitude manifest

16:01

sty referred to the idea which was almost universally accepted going back

16:07

the even the first half of the 19th century United States was destined to uh

16:15

cover the entire territory of North America or at least south of of Canada

16:21

between the Atlantic and the Pacific and that's what drove the expansion that's what drove the 1848 war with Mexico

16:29

which was a classic war of of imperialism and and seizing all of these

16:36

vast territories which were legitimately and and legally

16:41

Mexican uh in the 20th century this tension between those who

16:48

wanted the US to be Asian and those who want the United States to restrict its role to being

16:55

model for the world I took a somewhat different form was a debate between the internationalists and the isolationist

17:02

which was settled by World War II we know isolationist after World War II and there're are no isolation is now despite

17:10

rather promiscuous sort of use of of the term so I guess first point is

17:18

1991 strengthened and confirmed this belief which is rooted in the American

17:24

Consciousness both individually individuals and of course the

17:30

collectively two the second actor was the

17:37

uh notion which now has become almost universally accepted among political

17:45

Elites that the United States had a unique historical opportunity to shape

17:53

the world in its own image after 199

17:59

want and this uh represented the convergence of both classic American

18:06

idealism and those who thought in idealistic terms because now it can shape the world on our image which meant

18:13

Liberty democracy all kinds of good things and those sort of hardheaded

18:19

power political minded realists like Paul

18:24

werit who saw this an opportunity to to establish and to

18:32

maintain and to prevent any challenge to American and German it all laid out his

18:37

famous Meo of March whatever 8th 10th

18:42

[Music] 19991 and anyone who wants to understand American thinking about the world today

18:49

and its place in it and what its objective should be should go back to that memo because now the idealistic and

18:56

the the J M imperialist strands uh are are upated they're

19:05

intertwin they're no more pure idealist and the shift has been very

19:12

much in the direction W for which wanted to do and one of his

19:17

famous uh and extremely important and influential admonitions was United

19:23

States well let me see there two of them one the United States must prevent

19:29

the emergence of any other power that can challenge who might be in a position

19:36

to challenge American dominance right and the United States should Marshall

19:42

and and deploy all of the assets all of the instruments of power and influence

19:48

that his disposal to ensuring that such an unwelcome

19:54

development never occurs and of course you see that manifest in your foreign

19:59

policy today right it's it's what sax calls full Spectre full spectrum

20:06

dominance that in military terms but there been full spectrum dominance in every region

20:14

of the world and that provided the the stimul ification for the United States

20:21

building up this sort of galaxy of bases everywhere which is continued we have

20:27

bases now in in one form or another I don't know the latest count is 82 sort

20:34

of 109 countries and a compulsion to build them to maintain

20:41

them and try and exercise influence and just one sort of quick elaboration on on

20:49

on the first point this the will for its

20:54

admonition is what drives the current hostility

21:00

to toward China toward Russia towards

21:07

Iran and towards all kinds of minor players everyone from from

21:13

Venezuela and Nicaragua and and

21:18

Cuba to Syria uh to to

21:25

pre-revolution Libya Etc and this sort of aggressiveness has

21:31

become the the characteristic trait the signature trait of American foreign

21:39

foreign relations and that's what what's

21:44

[Music] driving and so with go ahead

21:50

please thank you you know there is this um there's a tendency to

21:57

ascribe milit ISM and and and the the the EXP the expansion of the Empire and

22:03

so on to the military-industrial complex or to the media or to certain

22:09

politicians but the interesting thing is that it is all of these things combined

22:15

that then of course find an umbrella in this Messianic

22:21

uh way of thinking right which then is which often is then defended um by some

22:27

politicians at set rant and that that plays into the entire the entire system

22:32

what you're pointing out and that you're using the term idealism is quite interesting next week I'm going to interview two two Scholars who who wrote

22:40

a really great piece about George Washington who was you know today he

22:45

would be called an isolationist uh at the time of course he was the one he was the US Statesman who

22:52

who tried to constrain Jefferson in saying like dude we're not we're not trying to venture into to these European

22:59

Affairs let these idiots kill themselves we going to do on our continent what we need to do and there was always this

23:06

this this Tendencies what you just describe between the idealists who want to who want to latch on to a to a

23:14

greater narrative about what Humanity should be and then push that out and the

23:19

those who want to constrain it and just one more thing the these people would never have described themselves as

23:24

isolationists never even before the second world war they always described themselves as neutralists or neutral

23:31

those who want the US to be to be neutral the term isolationist is itself an invention of the postc world war

23:37

period to to smear these people um there's a beautiful essay about a beautiful um

23:45

histo historical piece about this by by by a great um I forgot her name historian I think from Boston um you

23:53

know how this is post facto then then ascribed to them but this tendency seems to be there and this tandem even the

24:00

restrainers they were never against you know war with the with the native tribes

24:05

Washington was very much in favor of that and building the nation based upon a strong Army um so and it seems to to

24:14

me that the US these two forces they go hand in hand and then they build actually what you're seeing now

24:22

um the idea is I mean you're you're absolutely right and that virgin first

24:29

uh surfaced at the time of the French Revolution yes yes Jefferson whom you

24:35

site you know was very sympathetic to it and he wanted the US to back in those

24:41

days that simply meant rhetorically and and politically uh you know the

24:48

Revolutionary forces and of course there was a certain amount of posturing about that in a way

24:55

if you want to draw a very rough comparison Jefferson was the you know the Emmanuel

25:03

maon of his time not very flattering to Jefferson no but flattering probably to

25:11

m h since Jefferson did have some very Great accomplishments to his credit

25:17

which maon clearly has none but it sort of

25:23

posturing you know demonstrating that you really in the right you know what's true and you know

25:30

what's virtuous Etc but this kind of idealism sort of

25:36

continue right through and it's let's think of it in terms of the

25:42

last decade or the well post 911 era

25:48

right um the the the move or the movement for

25:56

the United States to scour the globe looking for evildoers or potential

26:04

evildoers accompanied by the Au auxiliary belief and

26:10

purpose that uh the United States had to take action to remove anyone who was

26:19

sympathetic to a facilitator of terrorism or frankly anybody who got in

26:25

our way uh that two combine realism and idealism remember the something a slogan

26:34

or Oro which was very popular till a few years ago called

26:42

um the right to protect yeah r2p

26:49

RP right and that came that came in the wake of the Bosnian particularly

26:56

disaster and the Rwanda aair and this

27:01

T deep-seated American idealism and we had to

27:07

intervene on humanitarian grounds you know what's happened over the ensuing whatever 158 20 22 years is

27:17

that this humanitarian principle or impulse ideal

27:22

has been weaponized of course yeah and use it selectively to deny countries we

27:29

don't like in power political terms and we don't use it or apply it in those

27:38

situations where the the perpetrator is somebody we consider an ally or a friend

27:45

as Israel and Gaza the ultimate case but the cases like that numerous Cas cases

27:52

like that the personification of this is is this woman who is now had

27:58

us Aid uh Powers yeah um and she she became

28:08

in effect the the inspiration for this R 2p movement after Bosnia and she's the

28:17

one who wrote the book deifying in effect what was his name the

28:23

Brazilian uh Diplomat who Peacemaker mediator who was

28:29

blown up in a bombing in Baghdad Dello right and then she became un

28:37

Ambassador over under Obama and she's reappeared again and as

28:42

a un Ambassador she defended every odious American

28:49

Ally and concentrated on you know attacking with the

28:54

vment uh the Chinese because of what goes on in in in Shing Jang Province etc

29:02

etc so genuine idealism which has been a very as you

29:10

you just said a very strong current in American thinking in American self-image and and so forth uh has been

29:20

absorbed and and and and become just a support

29:25

for what is a very straightforward and and and and

29:33

onerous uh foreign policy of domination that's that's that's

29:40

that's where we are now and it's well why we just leave it there and the

29:46

interesting thing to me is that a lot of the Europeans like that they like that in in

29:53

the elites I mean this is the the satellites are now so tightly integrated that you know they they don't only go

30:01

along because they have to it's not because there's a gun pointed at them it's because a good part of the elite

30:07

has swallowed the pill hole it was so interesting yesterday I had a discussion with a Swiss historian the guy hates my

30:14

guts or he hates my opinions uh very much so he's he also he he doesn't belong to our epistemic bubble he very

30:21

much belongs to the other one and um the

30:26

when I you know when when I point out all of these contradictions in the in the general narrative like okay on the

30:34

one hand great humanitarian great humanitarian Force like uh r2p and and

30:39

everything for Humanity and we have to protect the ugers in Shin Jang and so on but then you have this problem that

30:46

forever uh there was complete support by the US and the Europeans for Saudi Arabia a regime that every year like

30:54

literally beheads dozens of people and and then the reply to that is look just

31:01

because we cannot we are not able to stop

31:06

certain uh wrongdoers that doesn't mean that we shouldn't shouldn't oppose the

31:11

wrongdoing and the evildoing of those who we can oppose kind of accepting that

31:17

there are geopolitical realities okay for which we cannot cannot use our principles on on one set of States but

31:24

that we very much should weaponize them on on on those who are we who who we

31:30

don't want to be friendly with this is this was fascinating to me and it's because they need to square this problem

31:37

right and this hypocrisy and this is why you pointed out you know the moral defeat right I mean Saudi Arabia could

31:43

still be ignored like what and and the and the other kind of support for for autocratic and and and outspoken like

31:50

dictatorial regimes those could still be ignored but what we cannot ignore anymore the world can't ignore Gaza

31:57

right Gaza lays it all bare it's like all open for everybody to see that the whole show about human rights even

32:04

though some people very much believe in it I do think human rights are a great idea and we shouldn't get rid of them at all they are a good idea but they have

32:10

been weaponized to the point where they are just another instrument in the toolbox of

32:17

hegemony that unfortunately is absolutely

32:22

correct and that's the great tragedy of the worst but it's a tragedy which is

32:29

not just a a well I said a moral tragedy it's having profound

32:35

practical consequences uh now the the original

32:41

initial formulation of you quoted or cited sort of Swiss

32:48

historian not entirely unreasonable I mean you to say that there are

32:53

situations in which you can inter one way or

32:59

another uh to prevent you know diabolical things from

33:05

occurring and there are other instances which you cannot that's common sense

33:11

right but the underlying hypocrisy which has always been there whether

33:18

acknowledged or acknowledged to oneself or or or not

33:25

uh that's of the past I mean Gaza is the ultimate stress

33:32

test you know it's like a a you take a a a picture x-ray of the body as a fluid

33:41

passes through it and the fluid highlights the actual state of and

33:47

functioning of vital organs and Gaza is a stress test and what it's shown is a

33:56

West that is racist however you want to define the turn the point is what was occurring to

34:02

the Gins occur to was inflicted on any Europeans you wouldn't get this not this blly response

34:11

but this complicity we are in legal terms you know

34:18

accomplishes before during the fact and as they say you know

34:24

I'm um and that has to be in part in terms of racism of course the the the the

34:31

emotions associated with everything that concerns Jews is gives this situation a

34:39

unique flavor and you know I wrote a piece back last year we regard to this also on

34:47

my homepage you can find it there I'll link it oh great and it inflicts the US

34:55

and and in Europe in somewhat different way uh but it's in the United

35:02

States there aren latent feelings of guilt for historical persecution of of

35:08

Jews leading to the ultimate uh you know sin of of of the

35:15

Holocaust right but the United States what you have is an enormous political

35:20

power exercise by Israel Lobby uh and it's that too has been

35:29

exposed to the you know in its full extent uh and it's

35:37

exercised as well mainly in as far as the government's concerned in donations campaign

35:46

donations um you know they spend hundreds of millions of dollars in

35:51

support candidates and you turns out well you can you can buy a US

35:56

congressman at a really quite reasonable price and you can buy a US sort of

36:02

Senator or you know that price plus a certain you know

36:09

supplement of course in Senators have to run for election every six years or

36:14

other than two years as to members of the House of Representatives right yeah

36:20

the donations have to be a bit bigger you don't have to make them that often the

36:26

same uh and then influence spreads as well into into the media let's not go

36:31

too far into that but I mean what there is no

36:37

defense for Western complicity in Gaza there is no

36:44

justification there is no rationalization it's a blunt compelling

36:52

truth and 2third of the world sees it exactly like that

36:59

and part of the you know the conceit of the West which is associated with the history of colonialism

37:06

moralism which itself is associated with with racism of one kind or another or

37:13

racist attitude is that the rest of the world doesn't count but the rest of the

37:18

world now is not the rest of the world that was 40 50 years

37:24

ago yeah China China CH has the world's largest economy right the the members of

37:32

bricks alone constitute uh what 60 65% of

37:39

humanity and you be hard pressed to

37:44

find well not anyone you can never say that but any

37:50

significant slice of population in China in Russia you in

37:58

India in Indonesia in most of South America in

38:04

Brazil who share the Western perspective on Gaza and in fact most of

38:12

them don't even share the Western perspective on on Ukraine the

38:18

interest you're absolutely right and I just was in Southeast Asia and it

38:23

Thailand Indonesia you speak to anyone you want they don't share the

38:28

perspective the interesting thing is that of course the Europeans and the Americans they I mean even the Japanese

38:35

even in Japan like the these these these uh Wars are they are understood more in

38:41

the sense of how they are portrayed in the west but not quite I mean there's this way more nuanced the TV the TV

38:48

stations here way more they try to explain way more of where it comes from then try to to create a single narrative

38:55

which is what we are having this this unspeakable propaganda that that is that

39:01

is like just like a deluge like sweeping over us the the thing is that the

39:06

Europeans for the last five six hundred years they have always taken for granted

39:12

that their current narrative and their current explanation of the world is the

39:19

explanation and that everybody else who doesn't understand it just hasn't hasn't learned enough yet is is too far behind

39:26

just needs to catch up in order to understand the benign benevolence of you

39:31

know of how beautiful Christianity is you all have to swallow it whole how good our our our wonderful values are

39:39

every single generation in from Europe what time and again and they've been able to for 500 years or 600 years to

39:46

shove it down the throats of everybody else with pure might with the gun and

39:52

the ones that they didn't want to shove it down they even like we got rid of them right the Europeans they they they V vacated three continents of

40:00

their original populations three over the last 500 years um currently what's

40:06

happening to the to the to the Palestinians is probably the last kind of outgrowth of this the last attempt at

40:12

achieving a similar outcome and now this is not going to work anymore this is a

40:17

real genuine change in the way that world politics functions for the first

40:23

time in five or 600 years the white Europeans and Americans you know I mean

40:29

that's why we belong together right it's right right because they are immigrated Europeans ain't going to work anymore I

40:36

really wonder what that if we can avoid the third world war um based based on

40:42

the fact that this is a fundamental change well that's you're absolutely

40:49

right and you stated it you know with concision and very

40:55

articulately I think this is an this is a case in which the word existential

41:01

threat doesn't apply I mean the threat is not that

41:07

Russia is going to you know roll over

41:13

Europe right up to right up to cala and absorb all of those illegal

41:20

immigrants that so TR people on in the part it's not that China

41:28

poses any military threat to the United States or any of its its allies

41:35

right uh it's not that Venezuela poses a threat of any

41:43

kind consequential American interest in the Western

41:50

Hemisphere uh just you know looking at at it's rather the that the very

41:58

fact that they have grown developed strengthened and have their own

42:05

autonomous view of the world and how it works and worst of all their own ideas

42:12

as to how po should be organized right is not

42:19

just anatha in some sort of in to the West in intellectual

42:25

terms it seems to be somehow run it somehow runs against the

42:31

nature of the grain of nature right and we're seemingly unable

42:39

to contend with it with that actually we had you know when you think about about

42:46

China in particular and China really unsettled certainly

42:53

American Elites uh more than Russia Al the anti-russian hysteria and

43:02

Mania is very hard to explain you try out one hypothesis after another it it

43:07

and it doesn't doesn't doesn't work I think with Russians and effect have been

43:15

made designated by the West have been designated wogs in the British term

43:21

worthy or gental Oriental gentlemen a disparaging to term to all on Europeans

43:28

and therefore you can uh they constitute therefore a threat above and beyond

43:36

anything that's tangible and you can abuse them

43:41

verbally uh and you can justify trying to isolate them as we've done since

43:48

1991 Russia here I'm talking about not not the Soviet Union because they're not

43:54

us you deny them this say as the Europeans you treat them as

43:59

ws and if you look at the the Venom and the vment which is directed for example at

44:07

Vladimir Putin whatever you think of him you can disagree and criticize everything he's done he's not at all the

44:15

cartoonish person he's depicted not only in the mass media but

44:22

but by American and European heads of state yeah utter absurdity you know

44:29

Hillary Clinton calls him Hitler yeah but because you need need him to be Hitler you need him to be absolute evil

44:36

in order to justify throwing everything at him everything right fight so you him to

44:44

be absolute evil this is part of the of the of the vilification of the of the other one even I mean he deserves he

44:50

deserves blame on certain parts but yeah he's a he's he's being cartoonishly blamed for everything and this is this

44:56

is ridiculous us it's just you place him in the same box in the same emotional

45:03

box right yeah as Saddam

45:08

Hussein Gaddafi and even Ed Amin you

45:13

know they're all the wrong kinds of people the thing is what this does is of

45:21

course that if if Putin is Hitler then the only solution is to go to Berlin or

45:28

go to Moscow and bomb him out of the furer bunker right is that's the sad

45:34

thing that this that this rhetoric does um and of course like for the Feer it

45:39

wasn't the Americans who bumped him out of the bunker it was actually the S right that's what you know Victoria

45:49

newand that's what um you know former prime minister

45:55

Johnson B Johnson this is what Madam be

46:01

beach in Germany right uh this is what they would

46:07

like to do and all these odd people in in the baltics you know who and this

46:14

what is what they did with with Hussein right I mean Hillary Clinton is on the record how she said we came saw he died

46:21

or was it about Gaddafi about about it was Gaddafi it was it Gaddafi laughing she's like like you

46:30

despicable person I me just I know we have to wrap this up battery permitting

46:37

or not let me make another one broader

46:43

point which is faced with the rise of the non West which is China a m but not

46:49

just China it's India about which is a lot of ambivalent thinking in in in the West India itself

46:57

is unal to identifies you know

47:04

Indonesia we had we had a choice and the choice was to consider

47:11

them hostile potential Rivals to be suppressed one way or another we can

47:21

me you know think of various ways and what it means to suppress but we don't know you know the fors approach the

47:29

other was to recognize that this was now a given or the interational system but the United

47:38

the period of of American Hemy post 1991 is over for objective reasons and you

47:46

have to work out through sustained skillful

47:52

diplomacy terms of not just coexistence right

47:57

but terms of Engagement with them and so a lot of international institutions have

48:04

to be modified Arrangements have to be

48:10

adjusted understandings have to be reached through a sustained you know

48:16

process of of of diplomacy and you have to set you know

48:22

agree on rules of the road and I don't think that would have been

48:27

at all impossible because neither Russia nor China is inherently hostile or

48:34

antagonistic to the West per se neither one seeks world do you know world

48:42

domination and I think a truly farsighted and American and would have

48:50

to be the American American president right would begin this process and in

48:58

effect the foundation stone would be a benign concert not like the concert of

49:05

theer intended to suppress and to provide Mutual support in the event of

49:11

any social political revolution but simply a meeting together

49:18

informally to develop a common understanding as to what the the the

49:24

today's structure of the world is is and how

49:30

to how to operate within it how to conduct oneself within

49:36

it and you know this would be like the the the soft

49:41

core of a much wider concert that would involve all of the

49:47

major Nations you know Europe uh Japan Brazil IND are so you

49:56

know India right uh and there was I think it

50:01

was an opportunity to do it not just for the negative reason that neither of the two major nonwestern

50:09

Russia or China har is Ambitions to rule the world but think of you have

50:16

leaders in Putin and G uniquely qualified by temperament and intellect

50:24

and Outlook to engage in this process they

50:31

also exercise political control over their own countries to an exceptional

50:37

degree they weren't going to dis I'm talking about 10 years ago they weren't going to disappear or you know over

50:45

overnight right so they had both dominance in their own count using

50:51

that term in it neutral sense right uh they were able to cut cut deals they

50:57

would have been able to cut deals very few constraints interally

51:05

although you know some and had longevity because this is

51:10

not something you just put down on a piece of paper signed it and implements

51:16

itself and we lost that opportunity which was it to my mind a unique and

51:24

distinct historical opportunity which

51:29

fortunately op to us at a great historical juncture

51:37

historic juncture in in the life of the planet there is nobody among America

51:45

well last said nobody among American foreign policy Elites who ever thought

51:52

in these terms and there is nobody even today well there are a handful of of

52:00

very exceptional and distinguished people some of whom you know and have had on your your channel who recognize

52:07

it but nobody who is currently active neither in terms of the position or

52:15

office they hold nor in terms of the the public prominence there's not a single

52:20

one and I don't believe there is any noteworthy figure like that in in Europe

52:29

either I have talked to too many and studied about too many Great American

52:36

diplomats especially diplomats of the state department and and intellectuals to believe that there will not be

52:43

another one and and a group come up again there will they will come back and

52:49

we've have a history of actually also managing to do what you just described

52:54

to then use a junk we had 1975 the conference for security and Corporation in Europe 50 States

53:01

including the Soviet Union incl including America the United States signing an agreement a common

53:07

understanding of how to create common security we can pull off the same again on a global level uh conference for

53:13

security and cooperation on the in the a global conference for security and

53:18

cooperation we can hammer it out we just have to hope that the people will emerge

53:24

who who see it like this also in the West and it's a beautiful way to end actually so I I wish I shared your I

53:31

wish I shared your optimism I Jo for two reasons one I look

53:37

at who our next which of our sort of two contenders will be the next president of

53:43

the United States and two I live in

53:51

Texas go and shoot the guns m thank you very much for your time

53:59

thanks again for the opportunity to to talk with you and to talk to

54:04

whenever um audience sort of Clicks in the right place we will talk again thank

54:10

you

54:17
