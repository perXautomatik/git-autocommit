If you need to explain every expense at a workplace, then your clearly in the wrong place, find a location with more monetary freedome.

Money is not a zero sum equation, it's not single value equations, does who have money have no need to conserve spending, does who does not have money will be forced to cut detrimentaly.
A organisation that can not invest is a dying organisation,

This due to money being a continuous flow, and if flow can't be directed to growth, then the being is set to decline.

It does not matter how many zeros a organisation total value includes, only how brave it's wielders are.
This can probably be observed more in younger companies.
