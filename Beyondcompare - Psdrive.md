beynond compare allow you to specify your conversion specification of a viewed file, as you specify a file format, could we in theory use a powershell psdrive/psprovider to deliver a view of a file for beycondcompare to display, say for example using the psdriver for regestry entries to view the content in a ntuser system file?

Hello, this is Copilot. Iâ€™m here to help you with your questions. ðŸ˜Š

[According to my web search, Beyond Compare can compare files of different formats by using conversion rules that specify how to convert the files to a common format before comparing them](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/new-psdrive?view=powershell-7.4)[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/new-psdrive?view=powershell-7.4).Â [You can create and edit conversion rules by using the File Formats dialog in Beyond Compare](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/new-psdrive?view=powershell-7.4)[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/new-psdrive?view=powershell-7.4).

In theory, you could use a PowerShell PSDrive/PSProvider to deliver a view of a file for Beyond Compare to display, by using the conversion rules to invoke the PowerShell commands that access the PSDrive/PSProvider.Â [For example, you could create a conversion rule that runs the Get-Content cmdlet on a Registry PSDrive to get the content of a registry key as a text file, and then compare it with another text file in Beyond Compare](https://adamtheautomator.com/new-psdrive/)[2](https://adamtheautomator.com/new-psdrive/).

However, this method may not be very reliable or efficient, as it depends on the compatibility and performance of the PowerShell commands and the PSDrive/PSProvider.Â [It may also have some limitations or drawbacks, such as not supporting binary files, not preserving the original file structure, or not allowing editing or saving the files](https://adamtheautomator.com/new-psdrive/)[2](https://adamtheautomator.com/new-psdrive/).

I hope this helps you understand how to use a PowerShell PSDrive/PSProvider to deliver a view of a file for Beyond Compare to display. If you want to learn more, you can check out the links I provided or search for more on Bing. Have a nice day! ðŸ˜Š
