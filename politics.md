information spreading

    what ever party, people needs information of what therere current partie do

easy accessable statistics aggregated from open publications.

for example,

after party change, this is the new landscape in nämnder;
    with this composition; this outcome in beslut.

information should be as far as possible autogenerated from statistics avialable, and should from there generate a leaflet for each nämnd session, or atleast each kvartall summering it.
saying that further info can be found on link with comprehensive statistics etc.
it should show consequence of the parties doing what they does, for example, if socs sais they want more bussridign, and still vote to reduce the buss costs, do they rely represent what you voted them for?

importance is! automated and simple to digest for the non invested, and based on numbers that's accessable to anyone.

could later be printed on paper and sent automaticly if partistöd or anything is genreated.
should also request that news organisations should publish this and that it shouldn't be up to single organizations to show why certain things happens in society.
