any part of any file should be referable as a gist,
that is, i want to incorparate a copy of someones work in my code,
then i should make a reference to it, rather than download it,
add it to my code, then reupload it and some how hope that its noticable 

sourcecontrol could just as well be from a url, or div segment for a webpage atleast, 
with a management where you choose to update or not
