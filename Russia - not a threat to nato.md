0:00

could you talk about the significance of

0:02

these developments because you've called

0:05

what Germany has been found to be

0:08

planning an attack on the Crimea Bridge

0:10

which has happened several times before

0:13

um now it's a it's regularly attack

0:16

during this conflict whether through

0:20

mysterious terrorist events uh or

0:23

directly by

0:25

Ukraine and what was found of course was

0:28

that Germany was planning to help

0:30

Ukraine not just with missiles but with

0:32

the planning of an attack on the bridge

0:34

there's also Revelations that you know

0:36

British uh Personnel are in Ukraine uh

0:40

helping do to do very similar things so

0:44

the significance of this Scott uh and

0:47

and uh what do you think the Fallout

0:49

will be uh from these developments uh

0:53

moving

0:55

forward well I think the first thing is

0:58

we in order talk about this you have to

1:02

visualize you know what it takes to get

1:05

policy

1:07

momentum the reason why I say that is

1:10

you know the United

1:12

States took an a again Victoria nand

1:15

driven American policy took a very

1:17

aggressive stance on Ukraine at a time

1:20

when for instance uh Emmanuel macron was

1:23

saying that he doesn't want uh Europe to

1:26

be caught in a war between two

1:28

superpowers United States and Russia um

1:31

and he was talking about you know the

1:33

need for a European security um

1:36

framework that was sort of liberated

1:38

from this American pressure and so

1:40

macron was not somebody who was saying

1:42

we're going to send troops to Ukraine he

1:44

was the opposite saying we don't want to

1:46

push for this conflict uh

1:48

Germany look Germany was like we're

1:51

happy with the energy Keep It Coming

1:53

Keep It Coming Keep It Coming kind of

1:54

thing and you know we'll work you know

1:57

we'll play stupid games with Minsk and

1:58

all that but we're we're not leaning

2:00

forward for a conflict with Ukraine

2:02

either United States is leaning forward

2:04

very

2:05

heavily when you think about policy

2:07

shifts all that imagine a giant ship a

2:11

container ship um to get it going you

2:15

know because there's a lot of weight you

2:17

have to point it in a direction and then

2:19

you have to slowly build up ahead of

2:21

steam and once it gets going in the

2:23

water you ain't turning that thing

2:25

around quickly I mean you you know

2:27

making major shifts isn't a is it's

2:30

isn't easy you're you know you have to

2:31

move this mass and and and and and you

2:34

can move incremental but you're

2:36

generally speaking to be going the same

2:38

direction so once you get foreign policy

2:40

or national security policy together and

2:42

moving there's a mass there's political

2:45

Mass there's economic Mass um you know

2:48

there's domestic political there's

2:49

diplomatic economic all this is moving

2:52

in One Direction everything's working

2:54

together um and so what the United

2:56

States was doing uh for a couple years

2:59

was getting France and Germany to go

3:01

from this direction and move them in

3:04

this direction and we finally got it I

3:07

mean look the Germans didn't want to

3:08

send leopard tanks they didn't want to

3:10

send martyr

3:11

Vehicles now they did they didn't the

3:14

French didn't want to send the Caesar

3:15

artillery they did we in the from 2022

3:19

to 2023 we got Europe in this Direction

3:22

with the counter offensive and they

3:24

doubled down on that they they threw

3:26

more coal into the engine and off they

3:28

went they this is the direction they're

3:30

going Ukrainian Victory because

3:32

America's there leading the way

3:34

meanwhile America is sitting there going

3:36

this counter offensive ain't working now

3:39

they want

3:40

f-16s holy cow we're we're heading in a

3:43

direction where you know we're not going

3:46

to win this is going to be horrible and

3:48

so we started pulling back and slowing

3:52

down our momentum and then we start

3:55

moving meanwhile France and Germany are

3:57

up doing this um and and what what's

4:00

happened right now is that we have a

4:01

situation where the French and the

4:02

Germans are leaning Way Forward so are

4:04

the British because we told them to lean

4:05

Way Forward they're doing things the

4:08

French and the British have been

4:09

providing the British the Storm Shadow

4:12

the French the scalp missile these are

4:13

air delivered cruise missiles um they

4:16

worked to get the Su 24s which are a

4:19

Soviet era uh you know fighter bomber um

4:22

they got them modified so you can not

4:26

only Mount the missile but you have the

4:28

avionics inside linked up with the

4:31

electronics to receive the intelligence

4:33

package that comes in about you know

4:36

where enemy air defense is where their

4:37

Radars are all that gets turned into a

4:39

flight profile for the missile so it

4:41

could go in and hit the target and this

4:43

flight profile is updated after the

4:45

plane takes off it'll go up and get a

4:47

final update that's why we have

4:48

reconnaissance assets flying all over

4:50

the place and then they they launch and

4:53

they do Tech plan the people planning

4:54

that attack plan and doing all the

4:56

electronics aren't Ukrainian they're

4:58

British or they're French and um many of

5:02

them are on the ground loading in the

5:04

pre stuff making everything work all the

5:07

ukrainians do is fly and hit some

5:09

toggles and push a button but all the

5:11

other stuff is done by the French and

5:12

the British why they're leaning forward

5:14

that's their contribution they're

5:16

leaning forward and these these missiles

5:18

are striking Targets in Crimea um in

5:20

addition to Targets in uh you know in

5:22

the Russian rear area um the Germans

5:27

have been pressured now to provide the

5:28

tourist missile

5:30

um it it supposedly has more capability

5:33

greater range than the scalp or the

5:36

Storm Shadow um but the Germans are

5:38

running into a problem because as you

5:41

learned from listening to this uh this

5:43

this tape the

5:45

su4 can't do it it would have to be

5:49

extensively modified um and then the

5:52

Germans would have to put guys on the

5:53

ground to do the same thing that the

5:54

British and French are doing on the

5:56

ground to serve as that middleman to get

5:58

all the data loaded in up running you

6:00

need a a German team on the ground and

6:03

there's you know there's no not supposed

6:05

to be German troops on the ground there

6:07

so they don't want to have German troops

6:08

on the ground um and then the Germans

6:10

would have to be actively involved in

6:12

targeting and they talk about targeting

6:14

you know this isn't ukrainians talking

6:16

about taking down the Crimea bridge this

6:18

is the Germans doing targeting of a

6:21

Russian a critical piece of Russian

6:23

infrastructure now there's a couple

6:25

things here some people say that um

6:27

what's wrong with that Scott you know

6:29

the Russians are bombing critical

6:31

Ukrainian infrastructure I mean Fair's

6:33

play right this is purely a Russian

6:36

Ukrainian conflict I guess you could say

6:38

that fair is fair um but it's

6:41

not I don't think people remember or

6:44

understand what's going on in

6:46

NATO for instance if a leopard tank

6:50

breaks down it's removed from Ukraine to

6:53

Poland and sent probably to Lithuania

6:57

where there's a leopard refitting

7:00

facility uh where they repair the

7:01

leopard tank to bring it back into now

7:03

in normal Warfare that place would be

7:06

bombed it wouldn't exist anymore because

7:08

it's part it's participant in the

7:10

conflict in Poland there's intelligence

7:12

centers there where you have analysts

7:14

coming together or in Ramstein they're

7:16

doing the same thing Logistics flows

7:18

into Germany into polish warehouses on

7:21

in Wartime none of this would be allowed

7:23

to exist Russia would be hitting it um

7:26

Ukraine is getting this huge benefit by

7:28

having all of Europe to be this Safe

7:30

Haven where their Logistics where they

7:33

can train where they can build Weaponry

7:36

where stockpiles can be built up and all

7:38

this stuff and then filtered into

7:40

Ukraine but Russia can't attack that so

7:43

the idea of saying no it's a good thing

7:45

to let Ukraine attack the Kirch Bridge

7:48

it's a bad thing to let Ukraine attack

7:49

the Kirch Bridge because what you're

7:51

encouraging is war and War means that

7:54

Russia is going to attack all that stuff

7:55

in NATO and then we have a bigger

7:57

problem so I I don't think people

7:59

understand understand just how much of a

8:00

you Russia's fighting this war with a

8:02

hand tied behind its back because it

8:04

can't do the things that would it would

8:06

normally do to disrupt the flow of

8:09

logistics and combat support that's

8:11

coming from NATO from the safe haven

8:14

into Ukraine so we've got that but then

8:17

it's the Germans planning it this is an

8:21

active aggression Germany's not at war

8:23

with

8:25

Russia they're not I mean they're

8:27

participants in the conflict apparently

8:29

but they're not at War so what Germany's

8:31

doing right now and it's not me and

8:33

people Scott you're just throwing words

8:35

out there I don't know Saxony happens to

8:37

be a German State and the Saxon

8:40

government has uh initiated Article 13

8:43

charges which is basically the the

8:46

German Constitution that prohibits

8:49

people from engaging in Acts you know

8:51

Wars of aggression well why are Wars of

8:54

regression such a sensitive thing I

8:56

don't know maybe because the Nazis they

8:59

were Germans by the way um in World War

9:01

II carried out a war of aggression

9:03

against Europe and the Soviet Union 27

9:06

million Soviets were killed and when the

9:08

war ended um I think it was Justice uh

9:12

Jackson American Supreme Court jurist

9:15

who uh was a prosecutor in U at nberg he

9:19

said the greatest crime the greatest War

9:20

crime of them all is a war of aggression

9:22

because from that all other crimes take

9:25

place um and German politicians

9:28

diplomats and soldiers were hung by the

9:30

neck until dead for committing the crime

9:32

of a war of aggression um so the Germans

9:36

rightfully said at the time we don't

9:38

ever want to be in that situation again

9:40

but here they are four German officers

9:43

planning a war of aggression against

9:45

Russia whom they're not at war with now

9:47

imagine being the Russians and getting

9:48

this tape and listening to it going not

9:51

the Russians I think nothing took them

9:53

by

9:54

surprise first of all I don't think this

9:57

was Russian intelligence I'll tell you

9:59

why

10:00

I used to be in the intelligence

10:01

business and um if if I were able to

10:06

successfully tap into the communications

10:10

of four German Air Force officers who

10:12

are giving away the farm they gave away

10:14

everything in this conversation um the

10:17

last thing I'd want to do is compromise

10:19

that I'd want to say I want to do this

10:22

again and again and again as long now

10:25

that I know how to get in there I want

10:26

to repeat this um the other thing that

10:29

happens is when you do something like

10:30

this you don't leave

10:33

um a sign that you know killroy was here

10:37

you know the Old World War II thing you

10:40

know um apparently the this was a a WX

10:44

or something like that um you know yeah

10:47

it was a very basic WebEx system yeah

10:50

yeah uh but apparently in addition to

10:53

the four Germans somebody else logged in

10:55

and was hanging out there and it was

10:57

obvious there's somebody hanging out

10:59

here who's doesn't belong here that's

11:01

not how intelligence Services work you

11:03

don't leave telltale signs if you're in

11:06

there you're in there and nobody knows

11:08

about it so that they speak freely it

11:10

just shows you the low level of

11:12

communication security the you know

11:14

password

11:15

1234 a tough one guys um you know even I

11:18

could break that one uh you know but you

11:21

know so this this happened I think

11:24

basically it wasn't um it wasn't Russian

11:28

intelligence that did this this was some

11:30

sort of intelligence Affiliated um

11:34

hacker or you know because in Russia

11:39

they they do we know this um outside of

11:43

in Moscow at various universities

11:45

there's groups of Civilian hackers that

11:48

are doing it sort of Putin calls them

11:51

Russian Patriots and they're supervised

11:53

by intelligence guys who are interested

11:56

what what successes have you had what

11:57

have you done da but it's not a Russian

12:00

intell because the Russian intelligence

12:01

guys have their own tools their own

12:03

tradecraft and they're not going to

12:04

compromise that they're not going to let

12:05

these civilian hackers know the civan

12:07

hackers are going and doing their own

12:08

thing and I think basically somebody was

12:11

sitting there floating around and

12:12

whatever and

12:14

going let's see I'm

12:17

in they're letting me stay in they're

12:20

talking record holy cow look at what

12:23

they're talking about and it from what I

12:25

understand from Margarita Simon who's

12:27

the editorinchief of RT who received

12:29

this and who published this there's more

12:31

of this so I think that um the Germans

12:35

and they say including Schultz uh

12:37

there's conversations that have been

12:39

going on in this WebEx thing that this

12:42

hacking group has gained access to and

12:44

she has access to Russian intelligence

12:46

would never give Margarita Simon a

12:48

highly classified intelligence because

12:50

you burn the source um if this was

12:52

Russian intelligence we we wouldn't know

12:55

anything about it the Russians are

12:56

reticent it's not like the United States

12:58

that has a uh a tradition of um

13:01

Intelligence being leaked by politicians

13:03

I mean you don't have to have a security

13:05

clearance ladies and gentlemen just read

13:07

Washington DC newspapers uh when

13:10

something's happening and you might as

13:11

well have a top secret SCI clearance

13:13

because you're gaining access to top

13:15

secret seci information um because

13:18

that's how America Works uh if you

13:20

remember that leak when the the stupid

13:22

kid put all that stuff on the on the

13:24

internet the you know he put it in

13:26

Minecraft or something like that um he

13:28

just pled guilty uh to the crime that

13:30

that Massachusetts National Guard guy um

13:34

ladies and gentlemen you read it you had

13:37

for a while there for a moment a brief

13:39

shiny moment you had the highest

13:41

security clearances in the land because

13:43

you were reading top secret codw

13:45

material um and guess what it's not that

13:48

good and in many cases it's wrong

13:51

because it's the analysis derived from

13:54

uh intelligence uh that was collected

13:57

using um top secret code word um

14:01

resources um you know the it's not

14:05

necessarily the information that's

14:06

classified it's how we gathered the

14:08

information and so if I'm the analyst

14:10

and I'm gathering bits and pieces of

14:12

information and I put it together in a

14:14

product and that product is crap meaning

14:17

that I got it all wrong I I I didn't

14:19

guess right but there's facts in there

14:22

that's still going to be classified top

14:24

secret code word and so if you make the

14:27

mistake of thinking oh because it's top

14:28

secret it has to be good it has to be

14:30

accurate not really it many times it's

14:32

just pure unadulterated crap um as much

14:36

of that stuff that the kid put out there

14:38

was but um the Russians don't play that

14:41

game you don't see the Russians leaking

14:43

top secret information uh the Russians I

14:46

you know I think are pretty poor at

14:48

information Warfare in terms of trying

14:50

to um use the release of information to

14:54

um to to to change po this this leak by

14:56

Margarita Simon however is a deviation

14:58

from that it's genius but I think it's

15:00

because they got lucky enough to tap

15:03

into a source of information that isn't

15:05

protected by the security

15:07

classifications of the real Russian

15:09

intelligence service and instead made

15:12

their way so that by releasing it you're

15:13

not compromising anything um and it's

15:17

embarrassing to the uh to the Germans

15:19

but you know what the Germans did here

15:21

was an act of War here's the other big

15:22

thing about what the Germans

15:24

did Germany is supposed to be a

15:26

democracy and civil military relations

15:28

Is sort of what defines a democracy you

15:30

guys know the concept the president is

15:33

the civilian he's the commander-in-chief

15:35

and if he orders a general to do

15:37

something the general does it General

15:39

can't say no unless it's an unlawful

15:42

order um the general has to obey the

15:44

orders um and the policy is made by the

15:47

president not by the generals the

15:48

generals advise on this NATO when they

15:52

when when we were talking about

15:53

expanding NATO you know one of the key

15:56

things that had to be you know driven

15:58

into these for

15:59

communist block Nations is the notion of

16:01

Civilian control of the military

16:03

absolute civilian control of the

16:04

military Germany when it unified you

16:07

know had to be retrained in this and uh

16:09

supposedly they they learned what they

16:11

were that that was the case but here we

16:13

have situation where the chancellor

16:15

who's the highest civilian executive of

16:18

Germany has said he doesn't support

16:20

sending tourist missiles

16:23

to to uh Ukraine and the German

16:25

Parliament sort of the ultimate

16:27

expression of legislative Authority in

16:29

in Germany not once but twice has voted

16:33

overwhelmingly to reject sending the

16:35

tourist missile to Ukraine so the

16:38

civilian leadership has spoken the

16:40

executive and the legislative branch

16:42

there's no difference of opinion no

16:44

tourist to

16:46

Ukraine so why do you have German

16:48

officers who clearly state that they're

16:51

acting with the knowledge of the defense

16:53

minister plotting an attack on the

16:56

Crimea Bridge using the tourist missile

16:58

knowing that they would have to deploy

17:00

it there and deploy secret people and

17:01

all this Stu now you hear them saying

17:03

well it isn't going to happen it's

17:04

unrealistic going be difficult da d d

17:06

but why are they engaged in that to

17:08

begin with it's one thing for them to

17:10

say well this is a contingency plan just

17:11

in case they say how do we get these

17:12

missiles to Ukraine but they weren't

17:14

talking about how we get these missiles

17:16

to Ukraine they're talking about how do

17:17

we use these missiles to attack Russia

17:19

that's Ukraine's business not Germany's

17:21

business Germany has no business

17:23

planning an attack against Russian

17:25

infrastructure that's an act of

17:27

aggression that's a war of aggression

17:29

and so what we're seeing here is a

17:31

collapse of of civil military um

17:34

institutions uh civil military control

17:37

uh in Germany and this is this is very

17:39

problematic um and we see something

17:42

similar happening in uh in France I

17:44

believe I think that macron likewise has

17:46

seen the ship you know he's he's moved

17:48

in this direction and he's committed to

17:50

this and um committed to the concept of

17:53

a of a of a Ukrainian victory over

17:57

Russia and uh he's looking around it

18:00

isn't happening so he's basically

18:01

telling Europe you got to grow a pair

18:03

sorry to go that direction um you have

18:05

to you know man up um and and and do

18:09

something you're cowards if you don't

18:11

want to deploy your troops uh to to

18:13

Ukraine he's talking about deploying not

18:16

NATO troops but troops from NATO Nations

18:19

who are entering into um you know their

18:22

own unilateral security agreements with

18:25

Ukraine to send troops there um to to re

18:29

leave Ukrainian troops who are currently

18:31

not on the front lines maybe guarding

18:33

the belorusian Border maybe uh digging

18:35

in around Kiev uh to release them to go

18:37

to the front line because Ukraine has a

18:39

Manpower emergency right now um I mean

18:42

zalinsky has just come out and said

18:43

we're 700,000 men

18:45

short where' they go I don't know

18:48

they're all dead but they're 700,000 men

18:51

short um and they only have 200 to

18:54

300,000 Men available for the front

18:56

lines right and that's not enough and

18:58

they're losing men at thousands a day

19:00

right now and you know and they've got n

19:03

nothing

19:04

to to hold the Russians back so they

19:07

they're they need Manpower right now and

19:10

so mccrone having moved his ship in the

19:13

ship Estates moving in this Direction

19:15

all that momentum mcon doesn't want to

19:18

hit the breakes or turn around because

19:20

that makes France look bad so mcon is

19:22

saying in order to maintain this

19:24

momentum we have to do something that

19:25

keeps Ukraine viable Ukraine needs

19:27

Manpower that their number one pressing

19:29

issue Right Now Manpower over everything

19:31

else and the easiest way to get Manpower

19:34

is to basically put foreign troops in to

19:39

not in a Frontline combat capacity but

19:41

in a rear area support capacity to

19:43

relieve Ukrainian troops who can then go

19:46

to the front lines the irony is all

19:48

you're going to get out of that is

19:49

60,000 troops you're not going to get

19:51

any more than that um but that's better

19:54

than nothing that buys time to you know

19:57

maybe Ukraine can come over with the

19:58

magic mobile ization scheme which they

19:59

can't do um but mcon is is committed to

20:03

this and um so the French ship is moving

20:06

the German ship is moving the American

20:08

ship is stopped and America now

20:11

literally we're in a situation where our

20:13

national security has been hijacked by

20:15

France and Germany because they're doing

20:17

things that if they are implemented

20:20

commit us to a war that we don't want to

20:23

fight and the other thing about this is

20:26

uh the American people understand we do

20:27

have something called the con stitution

20:29

Congress is the only body capable of

20:33

declaring a war we're not at war with

20:35

Russia right now we're we're g to be at

20:37

war France keeps doing what they're

20:38

doing and Germany keeps doing what

20:40

they're doing we're going to be at War

20:41

but it's a war that hasn't been um

20:44

discussed by Congress has Congress voted

20:46

on this to declare war the president

20:48

United States of course can commit

20:49

American troops under the War Powers Act

20:52

but only you know in a situation where

20:53

we've been attacked and it's a pressing

20:55

issue and he doesn't have time to notify

20:57

Congress um but has the president said

21:00

this is what we want we want to support

21:02

this no the president's saying the exact

21:04

opposite we don't want a war we don't

21:05

want American troops

21:06

there but we're the American people are

21:09

ignorant of this and we're going to wake

21:11

up one day thinking that well it's okay

21:14

there can't be a war with Russia because

21:15

Congress hasn't declared war and the

21:17

president isn't articulating warlike P

21:19

fact he just fired Victoria nulan so

21:21

clearly we're not going to war with

21:22

Russia we're going to go to war with

21:24

Russia if France and Germany keep going

21:26

in this direction because it's

21:27

inevitable and that that means that

21:29

we've allowed foreign entities to hijack

21:33

Congressional processes constitutional

21:36

processes this is a very dangerous

21:38

situation for America for Americans um

21:40

for the world to be honest but I don't

21:42

think most Americans understand how bad

21:44

things are you should be calling your

21:46

representatives your senators and

21:48

demanding that there are hearings about

21:50

the potential of war with Russia and is

21:52

this what we want do we want a war with

21:55

Russia because that's what we're getting

21:57

and if we don't want a war with Russia

21:59

what are we doing to distance ourselves

22:00

from French actions and German actions

22:02

if I were the president of United States

22:04

I'd be calling up Emanuel macron and

22:06

saying um we we won't support you if you

22:10

put troops in there we will publicly

22:12

distance ourselves from you we'll tell

22:13

the Russians that there will be no

22:14

Article Five protection for not only the

22:16

French troops on the soil in Ukraine but

22:18

for France meaning if you take this

22:20

decision that means that France is now

22:23

at war with Russia and you're on your

22:24

own you get no NATO protection uh Russia

22:27

you you're free to just take them out we

22:29

don't like them anyways um Germany the

22:32

same thing sorry Germany but if you put

22:34

the tourist missile in there and you

22:35

attack the Crimea Bridge um you're war

22:38

with Russia we're not you don't get

22:40

Article 5 protection we're not riding to

22:42

your rescue and Russia has permission to

22:44

destroy you um we need to do something

22:47

like that to put these two Nations on

22:49

notice and need to put all of NATO on

22:50

notice that there will be no war with

22:52

Russia the only way there's a war with

22:54

Russia if Russia attacks NATO and we

22:56

should make this very clear um you know

22:59

when it's therefore we need Secretary of

23:02

Defense Austin to stop saying that you

23:04

know there if we don't win in Ukraine

23:06

there will be a war with Russia yeah

23:08

well there won't be unless Russia

23:09

attacks NATO which Russia isn't going to

23:12

do so what Austin should be saying is we

23:16

need to bring an end to this Ukrainian

23:18

conflict so that there's no risk of

23:20

Russia attacking NATO um but Russia is

23:23

not going to attack NATO it's it's an

23:25

artificial thing but if we continue to

23:27

lean forward like that remember we're

23:30

trying what Lean Forward means that

23:32

we're getting NATO to create domestic

23:35

political diplomatic economic and

23:38

National Security momentum that's very

23:40

difficult to turn around we need to

23:42

bring these giant container ships to a

23:44

halt and then we need to slowly turn

23:47

them and move away from the direction of

23:50

War thank you for tuning in to my latest
