folderSyncronizer
	Start program, list files that is stored in it's syncfolder, point it where each file should be synced to, then it will check every now and then
	that is, better than just dropbox, as you have to place files 'in' dropbox, here you only specifyies path, and program then make sure path 1 and two are synced
	combine with dropbox, as long as you are on computer with same name, profile of that name is used, and paths is synced specified, if new computer with profile not made, it asks where to sync folders that is stored in it's belly/in dropbox / if you wanna set new paths in general.

note manager


idea - albumcover managing
	you'r not entierly interested in if an album has same cover as another, you're interested in wich folders this covers is in
	so the best would probably be to go from double to double with a next button, and showing the result of the search
	in a folderwiev similar to infranview tumbnail editor
	the doubles result is shown like two folders that's is like a treeview down to each node
	the folders content is shown like greyed out songs, and other content and a fairly large tumbnail of the picture in question
	the menubar should be similar to antiduple.net
	where you can merge folders and or move pictures to other folder and or replace the other.
