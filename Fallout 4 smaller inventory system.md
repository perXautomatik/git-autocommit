# Fallout 4 smaller inventory system

To avoid the forever drag of the inventory managing, drop something looking like a backpack and a citizen in your nearest settlement will pick it up.

Turn on or off feature where citizen can die when trying to pick up the item.

Items travels in the pace to be expected for the citizen to walk back nd forth.

Wiew on mapp where this carawans is currently
Watch gathered items at the settlement that so far successfully bin gathered, 
Shoose gear for settler to go out in wilds with
Pay for the numbers of brahmin to assign to the settlers doing the pickup.
Pickup happens automatically when Dropbox bin created from the closest settlement, if it is allot of items the settler will take several trips unless with brahmins

Risk of enemieS attacking of course.

We'd need some sort of of armour strengthening or for this settler, ?
