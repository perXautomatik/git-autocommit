18. **Debting:** This refers to getting into financial trouble by living beyond your means. It's important to distinguish between necessary debt and excessive spending that creates financial hardship. Trauma can impact a person's ability to manage money and evaluate consequences.

**Additional Notes:** * Debt can lead to gambling addiction, unrealistic get-rich-quick schemes, and ultimately, homelessness. * People who grew up in poverty might associate material possessions with alleviating anxiety or fitting in.

18:50 _behavior number 17 is debting and by
