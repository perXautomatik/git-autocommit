Gather statistics from keytypes, windows chosen, etc, mappping pattrens and then making it into a simplified comprehensive graph
the point is to show this graph on the screen to remind you that yuor efficency treshold is reached, and you might as well take a pauuse and or sleep

the statistics won't be used to make you feel eficent, it will only remind you that you tend to be less eficent this time of the day.
this is a way to plan your days from your reoccuring patterns rather than what you think you should have.
