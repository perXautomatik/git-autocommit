It might be possible to make an Edge plugin that does what you described, but it would require some programming skills and knowledge of the Edge extension API. You would need to create a background script that can communicate with the Bing chat service and the active tab, and use the tabs API to update the tab title with the question and answer. You would also need to create a manifest file that declares the permissions and resources for your extension, and a popup page that allows the user to interact with your extension. For more information on how to create an Edge extension, you can refer to¬†[Extensions - Microsoft Edge Developer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions/)¬†and¬†[Create an extension tutorial, part 1 - Microsoft Edge Development](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/getting-started/part1-simple-extension).

A possible implementation of a background script and a manifest file for an Edge extension is as follows:

- A background script is a JavaScript file that runs in the background of the extension and can perform various tasks such as listening for events, sending and receiving messages, accessing browser APIs, and managing the state of the extension. A background script can be registered in the manifest file using the ‚Äúbackground‚Äù key, which can have either a ‚Äúservice_worker‚Äù or a ‚Äúscripts‚Äù subkey, depending on the manifest version. For example, a background script named ‚Äúbackground.js‚Äù can be registered as follows:

- A manifest file is a JSON-formatted file that provides the basic information and configuration of the extension, such as its name, version, description, icons, permissions, content scripts, action buttons, and so on. A manifest file must have a ‚Äúmanifest_version‚Äù key that specifies the version of the manifest format, which can be either 2 or 3. For example, a manifest file for an extension named ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù that displays a popup with a greeting message can look like this:

To test your extension, you do not need to pack it first.¬†[You can sideload it locally in your browser by following these steps](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&showconv=1&FORM=hpcodx#)[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/getting-started/extension-sideloading):

- In the Microsoft Edge address bar, go to edge://extensions and turn on Developer mode if it‚Äôs not already enabled.
- Under Installed extensions, click Load unpacked to load your extension folder.
- Select the folder that contains your extension files and click Select Folder.
- Your extension should appear on the list of installed extensions and on the toolbar of the browser.
- Test your extension and make sure it works as expected. You can also use the Inspect views links to debug your extension using the DevTools.

I hope this helps you create and test your own Edge extension. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me. üòä

regarding Edge extension API. Extension that's only active in bing search tabs, that communicates with the Bing chat service and the active tab, and use the tabs API to update the tab title, the extension monitors the inupt field of a tab that currently has bing chat open, when any text is typed into the query box, the extension updates the tab tititle accordingly, the extension waits for the 'enterkey' to be pressed, where it then stops updating the title bar, and instead looking for the 'share' popup, possibly limiting it's search to what's currently in view, if more than one; pick the last one , once it finds it; appends to the tab title the url of the 'copy link' option, until new text is being input in the query field, and the extension clears the tab title and inserts again what's has bin typed so far in the query field to the title of the tab

[gpt don't want to answere, ask about javascript doing this instead maybe]

From google bard
Here is a design for a Bing Chat extension for Edge that is only active in Bing search tabs, communicates with the Bing Chat service and the active tab, and uses the tabs API to update the tab title:

**Extension overview**

The extension will have two main components:

1. A background script that will monitor the active tab and communicate with the Bing Chat service.
2. A content script that will inject code into the active tab to update the tab title.

**Background script**

The background script will start by checking if the active tab is a Bing search tab. If it is, the script will inject the content script into the tab. The background script will then monitor the active tab for changes. If the user types any text into the query box, the background script will send the text to the Bing Chat service and wait for a response. Once the background script receives a response, it will send the response to the content script.

**Content script**

The content script will update the tab title with the text that is currently in the query box. The content script will also wait for the user to press the enter key. Once the user presses the enter key, the content script will stop updating the tab title and start monitoring for the "share" popup. Once the content script finds the "share" popup, it will append the URL of the "copy link" option to the tab title. The content script will then continue to monitor the active tab for changes. If the user starts typing new text into the query box, the content script will clear the tab title and insert the new text into the title.

**Communication between the background script and the content script**

The background script and the content script will communicate with each other using messages. The background script will send messages to the content script to update the tab title with the text that is currently in the query box or with the URL of the "copy link" option. The content script will send messages to the background script to indicate that the user has pressed the enter key or that the user has started typing new text into the query box.

**Example usage**

To use the extension, the user would first need to install it from the Edge Add-ons store. Once the extension is installed, the user would need to open a Bing search tab and type any text into the query box. The extension would then update the tab title with the text that is currently in the query box. Once the user presses the enter key, the extension would stop updating the tab title and start monitoring for the "share" popup. Once the extension finds the "share" popup, it would append the URL of the "copy link" option to the tab title. The user could then click on the "copy link" option to copy the URL of the current Bing Chat search results to their clipboard.

**Limitations**

The extension will only work in Bing search tabs. The extension will also not work if the user has disabled the "Allow extensions to access your browsing data" setting in Edge.

**Possible improvements**

The extension could be improved by adding the following features:

- The ability to customize the tab title format.
- The ability to limit the number of tabs that the extension monitors.
- The ability to display a notification when the extension updates the tab title.
- The ability to integrate with other Bing Chat features, such as the ability to share the current Bing Chat search results with other people.

To create an Edge extension that's only active in Bing search tabs, that communicates with the Bing chat service and the active tab, and use the tabs API to update the tab title, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new Edge extension folder and add the following files:
    
    - manifest.json: This file defines the extension's metadata, such as its name, description, and permissions.
    - contentscript.js: This file contains the code that the extension will run in Bing search tabs.
    - background.js: This file contains the code that the extension will run in the background.
2. In the manifest.json file, add the following permissions:
    
    - "tabs": This permission allows the extension to access and modify tabs.
    - "activeTab": This permission allows the extension to get the active tab.
    - "webNavigation": This permission allows the extension to listen for changes to the navigation of tabs.
3. In the contentscript.js file, add the following code:
    

JavaScript

```
// Get the active tab.
chrome.tabs.query({active: true}, function(tabs) {
  // Check if the active tab is a Bing search tab.
  if (tabs[0].url.startsWith("https://www.bing.com/search")) {
    // Listen for changes to the input field of the Bing chat tab.
    var inputField = document.querySelector("#b_form input[type='search']");
    inputField.addEventListener("input", function() {
      // Update the tab title with the current input value.
      chrome.tabs.update(tabs[0].id, {title: inputField.value});
    });

    // Wait for the 'enterkey' to be pressed.
    document.addEventListener("keypress", function(event) {
      if (event.keyCode == 13) {
        // Stop updating the tab title.
        inputField.removeEventListener("input", function() {
          chrome.tabs.update(tabs[0].id, {title: inputField.value});
        });

        // Look for the 'share' popup.
        var sharePopup = document.querySelector(".share-popup");
        if (sharePopup) {
          // Get the URL of the 'copy link' option.
          var copyLinkOption = sharePopup.querySelector(".share-option[data-option='copy-link']");
          if (copyLinkOption) {
            // Append the URL of the 'copy link' option to the tab title.
            chrome.tabs.update(tabs[0].id, {title: inputField.value + " - " + copyLinkOption.getAttribute("data-link")});
          }
        }
      }
    });
  }
});
```

4. In the background.js file, add the following code:

JavaScript

```
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function(message, sender, sendResponse) {
  // If the message is from the contentscript.js file and is a request to update the tab title, update the tab title.
  if (message.from == "contentscript.js" && message.type == "updateTabTitle") {
    chrome.tabs.update(message.tabId, {title: message.title});
  }
});
```

5. Pack the extension and load it into Edge.

Once the extension is loaded, it will be active in all Bing search tabs. When the user types text into the Bing chat input field, the extension will update the tab title with the current input value. When the user presses the 'enterkey', the extension will stop updating the tab title and look for the 'share' popup. If the 'share' popup is found, the extension will append the URL of the 'copy link' option to the tab title. If new text is typed into the Bing chat input field, the extension will clear the tab title and insert the new text into the title.

## Additional notes

- You can use the `chrome.webNavigation.onCommitted` event to listen for changes to the navigation of tabs. This can be useful for detecting when the user leaves a Bing search tab.
- You can use the `chrome.tabs.sendMessage` function to send messages from the background.js file to the contentscript.js file. This can be useful for sending requests to the contentscript.js file to update the tab title.
