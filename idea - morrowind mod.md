permanent enchantments needs "fuel"
	manapotions is automaticly consumed as you use them

alchemy requries more ingridients or more potent ingridients to make stronger potions
	this is to bring some realism to the potionmaking 
		you need many of an ingreadiense to consentrate it's effect
		makes it harder to make the extreamly good potions as you eather find rare ingreadiances or consentrate a big bunch

if you talk with a sitizen and don't ask it anything it might loose reputation points aginst you
		how rude it just called for me for no reason


wearing assassin outfit realy worsen your reputational response

first wave of assassins wear far more regular gear

citizens should flee rather than fight in case you steal or attack them, gathering guards

citizen should help fending of cliffracers if no guards are arround

citizens should trade in your goods you sell to local traders, in that way there apearance variate and the vendors goods variate

spread gear evenly over dificulty, the higher lvl you are the better geared adventures apears in town; so should mod made equipment do to, spread over the loot map.

note: installing some custom gear mod could increase armour varaity witch would give you a smother curve toward endgame gear¨



* killing Eydis Fire-Eye before gentleman tim gives you bittercup quest should update your journal of the bittercupps excistance even if you wont hand it to Eydis afterwards

* you shouldn't get the journal entry of Hlaalu horator quest, if you're not currently in Hlaalu, as you can't complete it unless you are indeed part of the house.

* each quest should point where the quest where given, say Tempel: Compassion "Tuls Valen wants me.."
to "Tuls Valen in X wants me to..."
