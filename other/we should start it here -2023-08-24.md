adam something showed his true colours ( na he was already clear on his colours from the start)
of being a conventional establishment leftist by critisising the upcoming german left party, which i think is a damn good alternative to the rest of the left.

there might be such a party in sweden, there should be, i should contact this party 

worst case scenario we should start it here...
