Which DVI to HDMI converter you’ll need to use depends on the type of DVI port your source device has. There are five different types of DVI ports, each one’s contact pins varying in size and number.

Refer to the diagram below to find out which DVI port your source device has.

### What are DVI-I, DVI-D, and DVI-A?

#### DVI-I

This nifty cable transmits both **analog and digital signals**, though it does not act as a converter for the two. This means it can connect two digital or analog sources, but not one of each.

#### DVI-D

This digital-only cable transmits **high-quality video signals** and supports **better connectivity** since it bypasses the digital-to-analog conversion.

#### DVI-A

Finally, DVI-A cables only support **analog signals.** While the video quality is still high, you can expect it to be slightly lower than the video transmitted via DVI-I and DVI-D cables.

This is because the video must go through the digital-to-analog conversion process, slightly reducing the final quality.

### Single-Link vs. Dual-Link

DVI-I and DVI-D cables can be either single-link or dual-link. This difference not only affects the way the port looks (see diagram above), but it also affects the speed at which the signal is transmitted as well as the video quality.

Single-link cables have fewer pins and only use 12 of them when transmitting video. Meanwhile, dual-link cables have more pins and use 24 of them during the transmission process.

All DVI cables use transition-minimized differential signaling (or TMDS for short). True to its name, single-link cables use a singular TMDS transmitter and support a max resolution of 1920×1200.

On the other hand, dual-link cables use dual TMDS transmitters, which increases their max resolution to a whopping 2560×1600.
