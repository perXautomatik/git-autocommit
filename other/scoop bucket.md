	ask gpt,
		modify scoops install app behaivor
			when installing app, 
				parse version, source bucket, install size, presist size
					dump as a version file into my personal bucket (deployed)
						commit and push 


* scoop

	config bucket
		file assosiations, 
			! get file assosisations from 
				bcompare formats
				git ignore repo
				wiztree
			! preview behavior
		centralized dictionary file
		file assoisation

	
* bucket with specific ATOMIC configurations
	* not presist, this is basicly calls to the apps api, setting changes
		or reverting changes
	this changes should be install path agnostic
			refering to schim
	hard requirment that program is installed
	such as 	
		system startup entries
		git config
		bcompare extensions (fetch all always so maybe not suitable)
		bcompare settings
		everything filters
		everything bookmarks
		ahk keybindings
		powershell profile
		smart git tools
		windows regestry changes (could be separate bucket, but same structure and rules)
		.....
		vscode workspaces?
			this changes should be auto generated harvested from monitored files
				then added with git flow as a separate feature file
					? could this be acomplished entierly as a gitflow action?
					? separate deamon monitoring line changes ?

	buckets
		set up git workflows for buckets
		set up fetching of relevant buckets
	git actions
		understand the current auto fetch behaviors
			sanitize behaviors so it's easier to fetch and push, fewer commits
		- my personal bucket
			where i store my versions of bucket
				(does not need auto download from othter than my own changes)
				! need to sanitize history 
					with cherrypicking from relevant origin 
						separate file history
						instead of wide merge
		+ the config bucket (could need auto commit workflow)
		+ presist bucket needs
	third screen
		could be a laptopscreen or a cellular
			good place to have gpt
	secondary mouse
		to be able to remapp without needing to change current mouse mapping
	learn how to install app the scoop way
		create scoop for arrogant bastard mouse
			description "cheap macro mouse purchasable in sweden since;" 


todo: scoop
	sparse checkout / fetch scoop presist
		that is modifying the spars checkout file when installing or uninstalling a program with presist,
