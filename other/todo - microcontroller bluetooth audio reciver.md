Yes, there are some projects that combine the MAX98357A I2S amplifier and a Bluetooth module. For example, you can check out these projects:

- : This project shows how to use the ESP32 board and the MAX98357 module to create a Bluetooth speaker that can stream audio from any device with a USB input.Â [It uses the ESP32-A2DP library for the Arduino IDE to handle the Bluetooth connection and the I2S protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24pk28oqVQI)[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24pk28oqVQI).
- : This project shows how to use the ESP32 board and the MAX98357 module to create a Bluetooth speaker that can play WAV files from an SD card.Â [It uses a simple circuit with a resistor and a capacitor to connect the speaker to the amplifier, and a Python script to control the playback and volume](https://www.electroniclinic.com/bluetooth-speaker-using-esp32-and-max98357-i2s-digital-amplifier/)[2](https://www.electroniclinic.com/bluetooth-speaker-using-esp32-and-max98357-i2s-digital-amplifier/).
- : This project shows how to use the ESP32 board and the MAX98357 module to create an internet radio that can play online radio stations.Â [It uses the ESP32 Radio library for the Arduino IDE to handle the internet connection and the I2S protocol](https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/esp32-based-internet-radio-using-max98357a-i2s-amplifier-board)[3](https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/esp32-based-internet-radio-using-max98357a-i2s-amplifier-board).

I hope these projects can inspire you to create your own audio projects with the MAX98357A I2S amplifier and a Bluetooth module. ðŸ˜Š
