each pion has "stress, hunger, sleepyness"
send stressed pions from farms, woodworking, stonecuting, battle, to the brothel to reduce stress
take stressed brothel works to stone working or shooting practice to reduce theres.

age pions from teen to mature, where fertility is higher but accumelated wisdom lower

wisdom accumelates from experience and from being tought

time stopped, untill decree is given, but with possibility to pause time

strumpets model types, including pregnancy and face expressions

keep forign races as lifestock or in breeding pen

initially wide sweeping decrees, as time moves on, layered decrees and more fie grained will be usefull

wisdome changes how fast a pion learns a new task, (in aproximately same field), and due to pion having limited life span, utelizing there precens sub optimaly

pions live and die initially as a normal human would, with lifespan of aprox 70 ingame years and being fertile form aprox 13, this needs to be sped up quite much of course

pions life span, firtility, wisdom modifier, strength, heat or cold resistance, waterbreeding, can be increased with exobreading, 

realms containing other races should have specificly adapted enviorments for such, giving you a massive hurdle if you want to acctually conquer another realm

think extream heat, extream cold, complete water submersion, floating islands, toxic atmosphere, 
however, some sort o grace zone to encounter halfbreed creatures...
