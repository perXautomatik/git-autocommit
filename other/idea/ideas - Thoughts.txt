alchemyimprovement121.zip... does it mean potions like 1% resistance to bligh or other to short to be significant bonuses?

skoomalab1.0.zip.. maybe more intersting as decoratino rather than actuall player usage, unless goldgeneration would get insanely hard with police interferances maybe.

completemorrowindpart1addon.zip so many simmilar ideas, so far non wich is exactly what i want, probably nessesary to use scripts that makes the game unstable, hum worth learning what makes the game crash from scripts in the first place, thinking of possible add script to each potion made, when made, hum that was intersting. maybe that's bether than converting already finished potions. maybe if negative effect then consider it as throwingstar rathern than potion on "equiping"

alchemy should endorse consentration, that means more ingreadinets not less, and that should also result in more effect per weight.

completemorrowindpart1.zip this could be intersting in conjunction with basic needs maybe

bloatedmorrowind.zip seems like a absolutely relevant detale.

bound_alchemy_v1.zip seems usefull but should alchemy realy be possible to be done outdoors or while diving in a pond? but still, nice thought for unrealistic convinience.

alchemy_1030.zip i think i want less ingridients rather than all does, but with bether overwiew maybe i could consider it.

potionsorter_0923.zip thought i already downloaded this one, but o whell

morrowind modding history need to cluster same mod with different version numbers.

Dark Brotherhood and Morag Tong Updated.. yeay! make it tougher!


cleanbethalizslefemm_v2_1111.. don't know if i need it but it is this kind of balance patches that's needed if i'm gonne add more custom made armours

Parrying Bracers.zip seems good for realisms sake but doesn't seem to realy ad anything as you'll still be unable to wear twohanded weapons with it?

byb_armor300_35 why the dependesies and stat overhaul? otherwise interesting simingly loorfriendly armorexpansion

Westsuit_by_Westly.7z maybe cute, sounds promising

Dragonbone Armor v12.zip better or worse then piviously downloaded?

fulldragonscale13a.rar male verson looks greate, the female... maybe not so

darbp_tb_full_v2.1.exe interesting, wonder why so heavy if just altering stats though

1SB_Argonians_v12.rar looks cute, think it's important to incorperate argonian craftmanship


1SB_LightBonemold.rar looks good wonder bout the stats

daedric_dwemer_resources.rar it's nice, rely nice
