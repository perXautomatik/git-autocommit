# Fallout 4 rebalansing

Set each zone item tables in accordance to progression, 

Not level, but where you're expected to reach when in the game, 

Also limit what sort of scarp can be gained from the area, maybe script scrapping to return only a procentage of scrap in the first areas especially more complex material, then as you progress the main story you unloc more advanced crafting material etc.

Equipment upgrades and attachments, severely reduced in the beginning of the game.

How about reaching Institute to unloc manufacturing

Keep loot tables to wood and pipe weapons and simple armour in the first regions, regardless of lvl, leveling upp only increases the numbers of enemieS spawning.

Keep bullets few, items found in bad condition awoid bullet spunch enemies, maybe alter enemy types with dlc low lvl enemy types.

The item sparsity system should run last in any order and should with scripts alter the final loot tables and spawn tables, according to filtering and if filtering insert instead from dlc areas.
