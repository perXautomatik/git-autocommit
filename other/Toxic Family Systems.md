Taken from a YouTube video I did about being a class clown. (personal story)⁠ ⁠ This dynamic is an example of childhood emotional neglect.⁠ ⁠ My mentor would often say that kids need so much repetition and help growing up. That had always stayed with me because it was so foreign to me when I heard it. What does she mean by help?⁠ ⁠ *The eight-year-old needs hands-on help with homework.⁠ ⁠ *The 12-year-old needs help to focus on their life - not yours.⁠ ⁠ *The child learning piano needs daily practice reminders - not criticism for being stuck.⁠ ⁠ *The fourth grader is going to need to learn how to put dinner on without an adult's help.⁠ ⁠ *High schoolers can't perform well if their life is unsafe at home.⁠ ⁠ *Each child needs a competent and healthy adult who knows a structure for their development and success.⁠ ⁠ But children are blamed anyway for not performing like a well-adjusted adult on the first go. This often results in struggles to start things, procrastination, imposter syndrome, and perfectionism in adulthood. Neglected kids don't get the help they need for a normal and right-sized process.⁠ ⁠ Follow for more education on childhood trauma.⁠ ⁠ Share this if you would like to raise awareness. ⁠ See more of my content on YT.
