Ukraine would develop its ties to the military infrastructure of Europe and

42:02

the West as part of the agreement um and one more one more point

42:10

on the on the maidon that I wanted to get to in reference to what Glen was talking about is that you look at the

42:16

the US um the hinki final act it states I forget in which article it's in my

42:22

book on Ukraine over the edge that parties to the CE and the Helsinki fak

42:27

are not to interfere in the internal politics of member

42:33

states now Ukraine was a member state so is Russia so is the United States so are

42:39

all the European States so what were they doing on the maidan promoting

42:47

protests whether the protests against corruption will legitimate or not and you know corrupt everybody has a right

42:54

to protest against corruption but that is interference in the domestic politics of a member

43:00

State since the since the Budapest Budapest mandum that many uh in the west

43:06

tried to site as an example of Russ of Russia violating agreements leading up

43:12

to the crisis like Russia had um by invading and and supporting the

43:18

separatists in the in the in East had violated The Budapest memorandum well guess what the Budapest memorandum is

43:24

based on the Helsinki Final Act so it was the West that violated the Helsinki final act before Russia

43:31

violated The Budapest memorandum um so all this goes to goes

43:37

to Simply say that both sides used Ukraine as a means the Russ the West did it in a far more aggressive far more

43:43

obnoxious uh form especially given that the driver of NATO expansion EU expansion is really the United States

43:49

which is located thousands of miles away from Ukraine whereas Ukraine is on Russia's border and is a legitimate

43:55

National security interest for Russia given the history that I discussed and so forth and so on it's not a surprise

44:01

that we we ended up in the situation that we're in now and and and we just seem to be doubling down right seem to

44:06

be doubling down we talk about inevitable NATO membership of Ukraine after this war is over and so forth and

44:13

so on so it's a it's really a geostrategic um disaster cat catastrophe

44:19

that that threatens world peace I just add something very quick on

44:26

the Budapest memorandum as it was mentioned because this always comes up that you know Russia breached it because

44:32

the Budapest memorandum of 1994 uh very explicitly said you know that the borders of Ukraine should not be changed

44:38

and you know the Russians British Americans all signed under so of course this is very reasonable uh changing

44:44

these borders as they did with Crimea is uh well was a violation of this however

44:50

uh there also has to be pointed out that the international law since you know the thir of establishing unipolarity has

44:57

been interpreted more and more you know according to this rules based International order which in the kind of the US and its allies can take the

45:03

freedom to it shouldn't be restrained by international law because it has a higher obligation to Liberal Democratic

45:10

Values so for example with the Budapest memorandum you know you had three

45:15

identical memorandums to Ukraine bellarus and Kazakhstan you know for

45:21

giving up their uh nuclear weapons uh and you know this had the the clause in

45:26

this memorandum you had the you know one hand it said you respect the independence and sovereignty of the

45:31

existing borders of Ukraine but also very specific a paragraph where it says you know refrain from economic coercion

45:37

decided to subordinate you know their own interests to the interest of Ukraine

45:43

and uh also uh yeah don't don't undermine their security or sovereignty in any way through economic pressure or

45:49

other means so this was also very very explicit so but but again by toppling

45:55

the government very much uh of course a violation of this but even the this was also breached

46:03

when sanctions were you know threatened against Ukraine with the explicit purpose of undermining the government to

46:09

support opposition and since you know this you know a similar memorandum was

46:14

uh given to uh was signed with Belarus um you know in 2013 the US placed

46:20

sanctions on Belarus and you know the US Embassy in Minsk they they they were

46:26

accused of breaching uh the you know the The Budapest memorandum and their

46:32

response was well it's not really binding that was the argument Budapest

46:37

memorandum and secondly not only is it not binding but it's not really intended

46:43

intended to undermine the sovereignty of bellus it was just to protect human

46:48

rights so because it's motivated by altruism you know we don't want to undermine anyone's sovereignty or

46:53

dictate their policy or interfere we're just standing up for democracy in other words we have the

46:59

right to excuse oursel from this memorandum so and this is you know wider

47:04

problem I think in the relationship between the west and Russia is you know we kind of began to abandon international law which based on Mutual

47:11

restraint and we have now this rules-based International order where you know the restraints are only meant

47:17

for Russia and our adversaries while you know under this Sovereign equality we have the right to uh breach all this

47:25

agreements international law because you know we can refer to democracy human rights as this higher or other

47:31

objectives so it just um my my point is

47:36

the United States and his allies as well breached this Budapest memorandum many times uh and then you know and then we

47:44

only discover this document it seems once the Russians breached it as well and you know I made this argument before

47:50

to many people in debates and they say you know pretty much you know T wrongs don't make a right you you know is

47:56

they're still breaching which is yeah correct but on the other hand international law is about Mutual restraints you know each side commit to

48:02

limiting what they can do in return to get reciprocity if you remove the

48:08

reciprocity why would Russia be restrained if we already said we're not going to be restrained by any agreements

48:14

anymore it's just it's very strange sorry I interrupted you Alexander no no

48:21

go I think that's a very important Point you're interested to hear what um Gordon has to say MH

48:26

no go ahead Alexander then I'll then I'll no I very very very briefly I mean

48:31

this practice of discovering legality when it suits you and ignoring it in

48:38

every other respect is absolutely one of the fundamental problems in

48:43

international relations because of course what it is doing is it is creating a completely chaotic

48:50

International environment you can't just isolate one part of a do of of a legal

48:57

treaty one part of a document saying one applies when it suits us another doesn't

49:02

apply when it doesn't when it also suits us um all International legal documents
