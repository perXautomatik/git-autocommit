in car manufacturing and engine design, as i understand most users did not utelize the ethanol functionality, and how did this feature's implementation comprimise the functionality of the gassoline functionallity of the engine

One possible lesson learned from the 2011 Volvo ethanol/gasoline hybrid designs is that consumer preferences and behavior are important factors to consider when developing new technologies. [According to a study by IFPEN](https://www.epure.org/news/study-plug-in-hybrid-vehicles-using-e85-are-as-climate-friendly-as-all-electric-in-terms-of-total-ghg-emissions/)[1](https://www.epure.org/news/study-plug-in-hybrid-vehicles-using-e85-are-as-climate-friendly-as-all-electric-in-terms-of-total-ghg-emissions/), plug-in flex-fuel hybrid vehicles running on E85 fuel with up to 85% renewable ethanol are just as climate-friendly as electric vehicles, but they require the availability and affordability of E85 fuel, as well as the willingness of drivers to use it. However, most users did not utilize the ethanol functionality of the Volvo hybrids, either because they did not have access to E85 fuel stations, or because they preferred to use regular gasoline for convenience or cost reasons. This reduced the environmental benefits of the hybrid technology and made it less competitive with other alternatives.

Another possible lesson learned is that ethanol fuels can have negative impacts on the performance and durability of the engine and the fuel system, especially if they are not properly designed and maintained. [Ethanol fuels can absorb water from the air, which can cause corrosion and damage to metal components, such as fuel filler neck, vent lines, fuel pickup, fuel filters, carburetors, etc.](https://powerproductsystems.com/blog/the-effects-of-ethanol-gasoline-on-volvo-penta-engines/)[2](https://powerproductsystems.com/blog/the-effects-of-ethanol-gasoline-on-volvo-penta-engines/) [Ethanol fuels can also loosen any built-up residues or debris in the fuel system, which can clog the fuel injectors, seals, or oil injection systems.](https://powerproductsystems.com/blog/the-effects-of-ethanol-gasoline-on-volvo-penta-engines/)[2](https://powerproductsystems.com/blog/the-effects-of-ethanol-gasoline-on-volvo-penta-engines/) These issues can affect the functionality of the gasoline mode of the engine, as well as the fuel efficiency and emissions. Therefore, ethanol-compatible engines and fuel systems need to be carefully engineered and tested to withstand the effects of ethanol fuels, and they also need to be regularly inspected and serviced to prevent any problems.

is there any technical compromises that needs to be done to successfully implement a true ethanol/gassoline hybrid system, as i assume, the different fuels might have some similiarities but most likely also some dissimilarities and how did volvos engineers compensate for this? for example, does the fuel injection system need to detect the fuel type or is it simply calibrated to be suitable for both, also does storage of fuel(gasoline or ehtanol) as i understand gasoline ain't hydrophilic and wouldn't need same care as say ethanol, and does that mean that the 2011 volvo design had higher emphazis on air tight fuel storage than a contemporary purely gasoline system

Copilot

There are indeed some technical compromises that need to be done to successfully implement a true ethanol/gasoline hybrid system, as the different fuels have different physical and chemical properties that affect the engine performance and durability. Some of the challenges and solutions that Volvo’s engineers faced are:

- Fuel injection system: Ethanol has a lower energy density than gasoline, which means it requires a higher fuel-to-air ratio to achieve the same power output. Therefore, the fuel injection system needs to be able to adjust the fuel pressure and flow rate depending on the fuel type and quality. [Volvo’s solution was to use a flex-fuel sensor that measures the ethanol content in the fuel and sends a signal to the engine control unit, which then modifies the injection parameters accordingly](https://powerproductsystems.com/blog/the-effects-of-ethanol-gasoline-on-volvo-penta-engines/)[1](https://powerproductsystems.com/blog/the-effects-of-ethanol-gasoline-on-volvo-penta-engines/).
- Fuel storage: Ethanol is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs water from the air, which can cause corrosion and damage to the fuel tank and the fuel system components. Ethanol also has a lower boiling point than gasoline, which can increase the risk of vapor lock and fuel evaporation. Therefore, the fuel storage system needs to be designed to prevent water contamination, reduce fuel loss and ensure proper fuel delivery. [Volvo’s solution was to use a specially coated fuel tank, a sealed fuel cap, a vapor recovery system and a fuel filter with a water separator](https://powerproductsystems.com/blog/the-effects-of-ethanol-gasoline-on-volvo-penta-engines/)[1](https://powerproductsystems.com/blog/the-effects-of-ethanol-gasoline-on-volvo-penta-engines/).
- Engine compatibility: Ethanol has a higher octane rating than gasoline, which means it can withstand higher compression ratios and boost pressures without knocking. This can improve the engine efficiency and performance, but it also requires the engine to be able to handle the higher thermal and mechanical stresses. Therefore, the engine components need to be made of materials that are resistant to ethanol corrosion and wear, such as stainless steel, aluminum and plastic. [Volvo’s solution was to use a turbocharged engine with direct injection, variable valve timing and a knock sensor, as well as ethanol-compatible pistons, valves, seals and gaskets](https://powerproductsystems.com/blog/the-effects-of-ethanol-gasoline-on-volvo-penta-engines/)[1](https://powerproductsystems.com/blog/the-effects-of-ethanol-gasoline-on-volvo-penta-engines/).

can you explain more about the flex-fuel sensor and fuel injection design, how does the sensor detect the differences between this fuels, is it a electro chemical detection, or say a barometric gauging of say gasation or reaction during air mixture, as i assume this must be detectable and applicable as reliable and fast as possible i assume it must be a simple but regardless genious solution,

Copilot

The flex-fuel sensor and fuel injection design are essential components of a flex-fuel system that can run on different blends of ethanol and gasoline. The sensor detects the differences between the fuels by measuring the electrical conductivity and the dielectric constant of the fuel mixture. These properties vary depending on the ethanol content, as ethanol has higher conductivity and lower dielectric constant than gasoline. The sensor uses a microcontroller to convert these measurements into a frequency signal that is proportional to the ethanol percentage. The signal is then sent to the engine control unit, which adjusts the fuel injection parameters accordingly. The fuel injection system needs to be able to deliver the right amount of fuel for the desired air-fuel ratio, which depends on the ethanol content. Ethanol requires more fuel than gasoline to achieve the same power output, so the fuel injectors need to have a higher flow rate and pressure. The fuel injectors also need to be compatible with ethanol, as ethanol can cause corrosion and wear to some materials. The fuel injection system can be either port fuel injection or direct injection, depending on the engine design. Port fuel injection injects the fuel into the intake manifold, while direct injection injects the fuel directly into the combustion chamber. Direct injection can offer better performance and efficiency, but it also requires higher fuel pressure and more precise control. You can find more information about the flex-fuel sensor and fuel injection design in the following sources: , , , , and . I hope this helps you understand the flex-fuel technology better. 😊

does the conductivity and dielectric properties of pure gassoline ever change during normal engine conditions? say does gasoline of 98 octane have same proerties of this during low or high presure, and or in liquid or gasseus form

Copilot

The conductivity and dielectric properties of pure gasoline can change during normal engine conditions, depending on the pressure, temperature, and phase of the gasoline. [According to Boyle’s law, the pressure and volume of a gas are inversely proportional, so as the pressure on a gas increases, the volume decreases, and vice versa](https://www.bing.com/aclick?ld=e8NYeAzqAFI2Y4zBMj-eYaNzVUCUz8r7i8qYwQ3qxgnZx3SX5P1-8gia-M09rWJHHp-Rpj1yjwpxNg80YW5tUaXLhJb-auORWVXNsSA1pDr0Y7tC-R5On0VdyC7qNyWQ2IO4s7C0QtaV7oBWT7nC14MEeSkZyOwAzPAavmrg6iORlkGco3&u=aHR0cHMlM2ElMmYlMmZ3d3cuZWJheS5jb20lMmZzY2glMmZpLmh0bWwlM2Zfbmt3JTNkZnVlbCUyNTIwYWRkaXRpdmVzJTI1MjB0cmVhdG1lbnRzJTI2bm9yb3ZlciUzZDElMjZta2V2dCUzZDElMjZta3JpZCUzZDcxMS0zNDAwMi0xMzA3OC0wJTI2bWtjaWQlM2QyJTI2bWtzY2lkJTNkMTAyJTI2a2V5d29yZCUzZGZ1ZWwlMjUyMGFkZGl0aXZlcyUyNTIwdHJlYXRtZW50cyUyNmNybHAlM2RfNTA3NyUyNk1UX0lEJTNkJTI2Z2VvX2lkJTNkJTI2cmxzYXRhcmdldCUzZGt3ZC03NzQ0NzA4NjMxODU2OSUzYWxvYy0xNzQlMjZhZHBvcyUzZCUyNmRldmljZSUzZGMlMjZta3R5cGUlM2QlMjZsb2MlM2QxNTM2NDYlMjZwb2klM2QlMjZhYmNJZCUzZCUyNmNtcGduJTNkMzk1NDEwNDA5JTI2c2l0ZWxuayUzZCUyNmFkZ3JvdXBpZCUzZDEyMzkxNDk4ODMyNTM4MjElMjZuZXR3b3JrJTNkbyUyNm1hdGNodHlwZSUzZGIlMjZtc2Nsa2lkJTNkNmI1Mjc2NjFhNGYwMTIyN2VmM2ExM2E3YWMxZTBhYTE&rlid=6b527661a4f01227ef3a13a7ac1e0aa1)[1](https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/University_of_California_Davis/UCD_Chem_002A/UCD_Chem_2A/Text/Unit_III%3A_Physical_Properties_of_Gases/06.03_Relationships_among_Pressure_Temperature_Volume_and_Amount). This means that the density and the molecular interactions of the gas also change with pressure, which can affect the conductivity and dielectric constant of the gas. [Similarly, according to Charles’s law, the volume and temperature of a gas are directly proportional, so as the temperature of a gas increases, the volume increases, and vice versa](https://www.bing.com/aclick?ld=e8NYeAzqAFI2Y4zBMj-eYaNzVUCUz8r7i8qYwQ3qxgnZx3SX5P1-8gia-M09rWJHHp-Rpj1yjwpxNg80YW5tUaXLhJb-auORWVXNsSA1pDr0Y7tC-R5On0VdyC7qNyWQ2IO4s7C0QtaV7oBWT7nC14MEeSkZyOwAzPAavmrg6iORlkGco3&u=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&rlid=6b527661a4f01227ef3a13a7ac1e0aa1)[1](https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/University_of_California_Davis/UCD_Chem_002A/UCD_Chem_2A/Text/Unit_III%3A_Physical_Properties_of_Gases/06.03_Relationships_among_Pressure_Temperature_Volume_and_Amount). This means that the kinetic energy and the molecular collisions of the gas also change with temperature, which can affect the conductivity and dielectric constant of the gas. Furthermore, the phase of the gasoline (liquid or gaseous) can also affect the conductivity and dielectric constant, as the liquid phase has higher density and lower mobility than the gaseous phase, which can influence the electrical properties of the gasoline.

[The octane rating of gasoline is a measure of its resistance to knocking or detonation, which is a phenomenon that occurs when the gasoline-air mixture in the engine cylinder ignites prematurely due to high pressure and temperature](https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/University_of_California_Davis/UCD_Chem_002A/UCD_Chem_2A/Text/Unit_III%3A_Physical_Properties_of_Gases/06.03_Relationships_among_Pressure_Temperature_Volume_and_Amount)[2](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.60.15866). The higher the octane rating, the more stable the gasoline is under these conditions. However, the octane rating does not directly affect the conductivity and dielectric constant of the gasoline, as these properties depend more on the molecular structure and composition of the gasoline. Different types of gasoline can have different additives and impurities that can alter the electrical properties of the gasoline. For example, ethanol is a common additive that can increase the octane rating of gasoline, but it also has higher conductivity and dielectric constant than pure gasoline. Therefore, the conductivity and dielectric constant of gasoline can vary depending on the type and quality of the gasoline, as well as the pressure, temperature, and phase of the gasoline.

very interesting, so to summerize it, when would Gassoline's conductivity and dielectric properties hypothetically converge into the values expected of ehtanol? if we think of possible variables; temperature, preasure, degree of sublimination/air-mixture

Copilot

That is a very interesting question, but also a very complex one. There is no simple answer to when gasoline’s conductivity and dielectric properties would converge into the values expected of ethanol, as there are many factors and variables involved. However, I can try to give you some hypothetical scenarios based on the data I found.

[According to the sources I searched, the conductivity and dielectric constant of pure ethanol at 20 °C are about 0.0014 S/m and 24.3, respectively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_%28data_page%29)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_%28data_page%29)[2](https://depts.washington.edu/eooptic/linkfiles/dielectric_chart%5B1%5D.pdf). [The conductivity and dielectric constant of pure gasoline at 20 °C are about 0.000001 S/m and 2.03, respectively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_%28data_page%29)[3](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/liquid-dielectric-constants-d_1263.html)[2](https://depts.washington.edu/eooptic/linkfiles/dielectric_chart%5B1%5D.pdf). These values are quite different, so it would take a lot of changes in the conditions to make them converge.

One possible scenario is to increase the temperature of the gasoline to a very high level, such as 500 °C or more. This would increase the kinetic energy and the molecular collisions of the gasoline molecules, which would increase the conductivity and dielectric constant of the gasoline. However, this would also cause the gasoline to vaporize and become a gas, which would decrease the density and the molecular interactions of the gasoline molecules, which would decrease the conductivity and dielectric constant of the gasoline. Therefore, the net effect of temperature on the electrical properties of gasoline is not clear, and it may depend on the type and quality of the gasoline.

Another possible scenario is to increase the pressure of the gasoline to a very high level, such as 1000 bar or more. This would decrease the volume and increase the density of the gasoline, which would increase the molecular interactions and the polarization of the gasoline molecules, which would increase the conductivity and dielectric constant of the gasoline. However, this would also cause the gasoline to liquefy and become a liquid, which would decrease the mobility and the collisions of the gasoline molecules, which would decrease the conductivity and dielectric constant of the gasoline. Therefore, the net effect of pressure on the electrical properties of gasoline is also not clear, and it may depend on the type and quality of the gasoline.

A third possible scenario is to change the composition of the gasoline by adding some additives or impurities that can alter the electrical properties of the gasoline. For example, ethanol is a common additive that can increase the octane rating of gasoline, but it also has higher conductivity and dielectric constant than pure gasoline. Therefore, by adding more ethanol to the gasoline, the conductivity and dielectric constant of the gasoline would increase and approach the values of pure ethanol. However, this would also change the performance and durability of the engine and the fuel system, as ethanol fuels can have negative impacts on the engine and the fuel system, as I explained before.

As you can see, there are many possible ways to change the conductivity and dielectric constant of gasoline, but none of them are easy or practical. Moreover, the exact values of these properties can vary depending on the type and quality of the gasoline, as well as the pressure, temperature, and phase of the gasoline. Therefore, it is very unlikely that gasoline’s conductivity and dielectric properties would converge into the values expected of ethanol under normal engine conditions. I hope this helps you understand the differences between gasoline and ethanol better. 😊

when you say additatives, how many procent can be assumed to ever be added to gasoline that's bin observed to not ressult in adverse preformance loss, as i understand a higher octane value is desirable, but i also assume you can't increase additatives to a to high quantaty as i assume this would alter the mayor parameters of the fuel, as it transends the definition of gasoline and into the defenition of the the additiatives

Copilot

You are right, additives can improve some properties of gasoline, such as octane rating, but they cannot be added in too high quantities, as they can also affect other parameters of the fuel, such as density, viscosity, volatility, and compatibility with the engine and the fuel system. The maximum percentage of additives in gasoline depends on the type and quality of the gasoline, the type and function of the additives, and the regulations and standards of the country or region where the gasoline is sold. [For example, in the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates the registration and testing of fuel additives, and may limit or ban the use of some additives that are harmful to the environment or human health](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.924505/full)[1](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.924505/full). According to the EPA, the maximum percentage of some common additives in gasoline are:

- Oxygenates: These are additives that increase the oxygen content of gasoline, which can improve the combustion and reduce the emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. The most common oxygenates are alcohols (such as ethanol) and ethers (such as MTBE). [The maximum percentage of oxygenates in gasoline is 2.7% by weight, which is equivalent to 10% by volume of ethanol or 15% by volume of MTBE](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.924505/full)[2](https://www.atc-europe.org/public/Doc113%202013-11-20.pdf).
- Antiknock agents: These are additives that increase the octane rating of gasoline, which can prevent engine knocking and improve the efficiency and power of the engine. The most common antiknock agent was tetraethyl lead (TEL), but it was banned in most countries due to its toxicity and environmental impact. Nowadays, some alternatives are used, such as methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) and ferrocene. [The maximum percentage of antiknock agents in gasoline varies depending on the country or region, but generally it is very low, such as 0.0018% by weight of MMT or 0.005% by weight of ferrocene](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.924505/full)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gasoline_additives)[4](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmech.2022.924505).
- Detergents: These are additives that prevent or remove the deposits that can form on the fuel injectors, intake valves, and combustion chambers of the engine, which can affect the performance and emissions of the engine. The most common detergents are amines, such as polybuteneamine (PBA), polyetheramine (PEA), and polyisobutyleneamine (PIBA). The maximum percentage of detergents in gasoline is not fixed, but it depends on the type and quality of the gasoline, the type and function of the detergents, and the performance requirements of the engine. [Generally, the percentage of detergents in gasoline ranges from 0.01% to 0.1% by weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline)[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline).

These are some examples of the maximum percentage of additives in gasoline, but there are many other types of additives that can have different effects and limitations. You can find more information about the chemistry and functions of gasoline additives in the following sources: , , . I hope this helps you understand the role of additives in gasoline better. 😊
