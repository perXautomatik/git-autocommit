# The rationality falasy

Wether a argument is rational or not might matter more in a discussion in persuit of logical conclusion, but when it comes to the case of personal experience, personal choose and advice, framing an action rational or irrational is only partly relevant.

Example statement, "person A will not show up to work because it's parent resently passed away"

this is a claim that could be scruitenised by not holding true from a rational perspektivet 

unless the parent was the only vheichel person A had access to to reach said work, there is no physical obstical stopping the individual from going to work.

However, this conclusion does not predict weather person will show up or not.

It can be debated if it is possible to quantify how much emotional anguish said person is in and therefore unable to spend time In any social setting, say we make up a rule stating, a person can't spend time in social setting if it's anguish level is higher than 3, and person A is at a 5 then it would be irrational to argue that the individual must present att work, as we'd overide a agreed upon rule.

With above example, we can ignore emotional validation of the claim and continue purely from a rationals standpoint, but this is a made up example and reality calls for a more emotional approach.

Surrounding indeviduals have a more or less emotional understanding / agreement with the situation person A is in

 it's unsuitable to not take such validations in consideration when attempting to predict weather the statement example will hold true, there will be a matter of cultural background, gender, work position, age etc to do a even more exact prediction.

Basically a purely rational approach is to ignore eventually emotional obsticals and or social acceptans for such. 

I like the example of myself with, the fact that I
"all minial tasks requiring movement between two locations can be done by foot and alternatively by bicycle and a car is therefore unessesary"

This is a self fulfilling statement as it simply led to me not moving at all instead of just agreeing that the situation required additional emotional consideration.

In the end, a rational statement or prediction is only suitable In some situations, and might be straight out wrong if used recleasly
