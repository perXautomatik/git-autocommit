0:33 _learned the word for the core symptom of
 0:35 _this kind of
 0:37 _PTSD neurological
 0:39 _disregulation now I had lived most of my
 0:42 _life disregulated and thinking it was
 0:44 _just me I would get discombobulated or
 0:47 _numb or too intense and I'd get clumsy
 0:51 _I'd trip over myself and drop things so
 0:54 _I learned about cptsd and disregulation
 0:57 _and I learned how to get re-regulated
 1:00 _and I felt so different I thought
 1:02 _nothing bad was ever going to get into
 1:04 _my life again but the thing is like all
 1:08 _people and especially like all people
 1:09 _who have lived through trauma in
 1:10 _childhood I had self-defeating behaviors
 1:14 _now I knew this and I knew it for a long
 1:16 _time and I thought it was just cuz I was
 1:18 _a bad person I was ashamed about it and
 1:20 _then I learned that it was actually very
 1:22 _normal for people who had trauma still
 1:25 _though I didn't know what to do about it
 1:28 _so what I learned was when you learn to
 1:30 _reregulate your nervous system it can
 1:33 _get better and if you've watched even
 1:35 _one of my videos before you know I'm
 1:37 _always talking about the importance of
 1:38 _re-regulation and I teach how to do that
 1:41 _you can find my my course on that or my
 1:44 _book re-regulated Down Below in the
 1:46 _description section but the problem was
 1:48 _even though I was re-regulating I kept
 1:50 _doing things that would knock me back
 1:52 _from a re-regulated state back into
 1:55 _disregulation and I'm talking about
 1:57 _self-defeating behaviors which I'm going
 1:59 _to list here for you so that you can see
 2:01 _if you have any of them when when I was
 2:04 _disregulated my self-defeating behaviors
 2:06 _would just get activated that's what
 2:08 _happens if you don't get disregulated
 2:10 _they don't tend to activate they might
 2:12 _everybody has some of them but
 2:14 _disregulation makes it so much harder to
 2:16 _control they just leak out they get
 2:17 _bigger than they should be so I had to
 2:20 _learn to re-regulate and I had to learn
 2:23 _to face honestly how I was sabotaging
 2:25 _myself because as bad as my childhood
 2:28 _trauma was I was keeping the effects of
 2:31 _my trauma alive with my self-defeating
