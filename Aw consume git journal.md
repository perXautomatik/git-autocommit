# SQLite dump to mysql

The Perl script that you are referring to is a script that was posted by a user named Shalmanese on Stack OverflowÂ². The script is intended to convert an SQL dump file from SQLite to MySQL, which is a different database system than MariaDB, but has some similarities. The script does the following steps:

- It reads the SQL dump file line by line and stores each line in a variable called `$line`.
- It checks if the line starts with `PRAGMA`, which is a SQLite-specific command that sets some options for the database. If so, it skips the line and moves on to the next one.
- It checks if the line starts with `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, which is a command that marks the start of a group of SQL statements that should be executed as a single unit. If so, it replaces it with `START TRANSACTION`, which is the equivalent command in MySQL.
- It checks if the line starts with `COMMIT`, which is a command that marks the end of a transaction and commits the changes to the database. If so, it leaves it unchanged, as it is also valid in MySQL.
- It checks if the line contains `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`, which is a data type and a constraint that defines a column as an integer and as the primary key of the table. If so, it replaces it with `INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY`, which is the equivalent in MySQL.
- It checks if the line contains `DEFAULT 't'` or `DEFAULT 'f'`, which are default values for boolean columns in SQLite. If so, it replaces them with `DEFAULT 1` or `DEFAULT 0`, which are the equivalent in MySQL.
- It checks if the line contains any single quotes (`'`) that are not preceded by a backslash (`\`). If so, it escapes them by adding a backslash before them, as MySQL requires single quotes to be escaped in strings.
- It prints the modified line to the standard output, which can be redirected to a new file.

I hope this explanation helps you understand how the Perl script works. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask me. ðŸ˜Š
