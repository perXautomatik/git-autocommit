# Neurons and delision

Assumptions;
The brain seeks to save energy.
The brain can be described as a network of neurons
With the help of help of hormones the neurons can solidify or dissolve bias.
A neuron is comparable to a transistor (electronically)
A neuron is comparable to a node in a neural network
A neuron receives electrical impulses from one of it's several connections and due to its bias it eather reply quickly or slowly or not at all.
The response rate is then enforced or altered by hormonal influx short after pulse, resulting in a etching of the behavior/bais.
The neuron fires to all it's connections or to some according to bais.


Neurial activity assumption

Neural fire ->
Action - no confirming nor disscuriging response.


Neural fire ->
Action - minor confirming response causing some neurons to strengthen there bias towards latest pulse, 


Neural fire ->
Action - mayor confirmation, all neurons get there latest states reinforced.

Question

Is the hormonal influx only rigidifying or desolving bias, or does it do more complex process is?

Bias could be conductivity, that is a part of the neuron that due to reinforcement is more prone to conduct.

Due to the assumption that a neuron could be compared to a transistor electronically, that on stimulus, responding with a signal output to x channels.
Each channels bias can then be more or less conductive to as the network evolves.


How does diacticated neurons fit into this? Does the neurons know they them self consume energy and some how limit the resource if possible, 

What ever behavior that is reinforced must be allowed to cost energy and we could therefore make the assumption that a action that is deemed positive is allowed to cost resources, for example large neural discharges, while something uninteresting will cause as few discharges as possible to conserve energy.
