The distribution network

Mines produce x eggs per day
Fishing hamlets produce x sea related products
Farms produce x resources per day.

Citizen eat a number of food items a day at some value, each citizen have to produce about that value + little bit more than there dayly food cost

Citizen can be given suitable resource for there professions, by schedule, that then on schedule locates a trader in its vecinety and uses this generated items to barter for food items, 
The trader should caravan to another settlement, other to sell or to buy, In accordance with the resources they have accumulated from there local sitizien bartered goods and with a estimated goal to purchase enough goods to sell the citizens back.

This would dynamically result in trade flow, that could be interupted by carvans getting lost or the player purchasing all the food items expected to be traded for this month.

The schedules could be dynamically updated by assuming that each citizen survive on there own generation but that there is a surplus that can be harnessed by a trader.

The player can be a spectator, a disruptor or a participant in this system as they may intercept a villigare going to the trader by iether buying there generated resource or selling them food items enough for there dayly trade.

Distance to trader, resources value/generation rate and supply and demand need to influence how often the trader does it's caravans, how often the citizens does there trading.

The systems is not likely to be optimal, or even functional, but could be at least cool as an experiment to see just how likely the original Morrowind ok infrastructure could sustain a economy
