so when a person of color goes to latin
09:26
america to be around other quote
09:27
people of color it's a love match
09:30
they're going to love
09:31
kamala harris in latin america it's
09:34
obvious that's how our credentialed
09:36
class
09:36
thinks people of color love people of
09:38
color unfortunately for kamal harris
09:41
that is not actually how latin americans
09:43
think latin america is not america latin
09:45
america is a traditional society
09:47
people in latin america are still
09:48
allowed to their great credit to say
09:50
obvious things they haven't been trained
09:52
by their leaders to censor their
09:54
unapproved thoughts so sometimes they
09:55
just go ahead and utter them
09:57
as kamala harris found out yesterday
09:59
when she arrived in guatemala
10:01
her motorcade was mobbed by protesters
10:04
not trying to get her autograph or buy
10:06
her superhero books
10:08
but telling her to get the hell out of
10:09
their country kamala would go home read
10:12
one placard
10:13
another sign near the presidential
10:14
palace this one really hurt read this
10:16
kamala trump won
10:20
now to a certain kind of liberal this
10:22
was shocking and some of the press pool
10:23
seemed shocked by it
10:25
but they shouldn't have been shocked
10:26
guatemalans of all people know what
10:28
political corruption looks like because
10:30
they live in a corrupt system and they
10:32
looked up to the united states and they
10:33
saw the presidential election wasn't
10:35
exactly on the level because it wasn't
10:37
they knew that all the powerful people
10:39
in the u.s were on one side
10:40
joe biden's side and so they trusted the
10:43
outcome less
