# Morrowind mod

Toxic archery.

While using a skill called toxic archery, 
Gained from having a item in inventory
Automatically assign negative effect potions to your next arrow fired.
On arrow hit, consume potion, as if target hit just drank the potion.

Script needs to identify negative potions aka poisons.
     Script needs to wait for successful arrow impact.
            Script needs to apply potion effect to arrow.

Mod should be as automatic as possible, just activate skill and shoot, watch your negative potions disappear.
Basically, allow you to practice alchemy like normal but use the wasted potions for some good.
While allowing maximum customisation regarding choose of bow and quill.

Could depend on 
       Smart fletching, auto assign ammunition as you run out
        Poison making, weapon coating or potion throwing is closely related.

Fixed splash effect?
