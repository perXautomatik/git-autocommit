# Twitter musk

A counter argument I got last time I brought up the Elon musk bubble was, the Twitter stocks have recovered, as a argument that everything is fine and dandy, anyone got a good rebuke to this observation?

Statement: "what stocks, It's not a publicly traded company anymore"

I was shown something that looked like the evaluation of stocks, from some trading platform like e-toro. in the wake of it all, I did not reflect on that Elon did indeed buy the company so why would it trade at all, What your pointing out makes me think that it was maybe an estimation of what Twitter would be trading for today.
