why does anyone breed animals? in breading season it seems to be for sexual purpuses mostly
in cloud meadow we do it for combat

shift the focus more towards bio sience and less to fantasy.

we want to revard the player for mixing all sorts of creatures, but also be able to make active choises for the sake of maximising proffit

we can still have humanoid looking animals as if we imagine a world where the only cattle is human like cattle
then it's no problem using them for cattle like industry.

sure it's most of the genre to be engaging with each animal eather by your avatar or by other animals
but you can still ressult it in a somewhat realistic product.

i think it makes even more sense if we bread cattle for meat, hide and milk
horses for racetrax and teenagers
lizards for skin 
birds for eggs
mice for animal experiemtns and food for reptiles

crossbreading should be a natural part of the society the game partakes in, but that doesn't make each creature of same race, 
theyere most defenitly of different breed, but could be part of the world that it doesn't matter races difference weather or not they can cause 
offspring, with sucha rule of nature, there would be greate value in crossbreading, especially if it's benificial to get certain traits.

it's basiclly bioengerineering with less pipetting and more fucking.

to balance it out, we'd need something like, case of crossbreading; 50 chance offspring is of eather x or y race, case it becomes x it will 
then take 10% properties of y, 
this way it will be "modified" by the crossbreading.


different animals should have different requirements, say cows should eater grow muscles fast or produce mik

if you add wolf dna to your cow brood; it might increase it's muscleproduction and therefore being a valid startegy for the sake 
of reaching your customers demands.

same, horses might be fast or friendly, maybe mix with cat for higher dexterity, but risk making them harder to tame.

we should of course not make the dna system 


Breeding season is the start of the genre and doing things pretty darn good
cloud meadow continued the trend but still didnt' adress all the potential

First of all, why do we have to have that selection of "animals"
where is the mouses? the lizards? the sharks? and the question is how do we incorpeat
them in such obsurd context.

first of all, i think "breedingFarm" does a good work in empasising that this si a managing game first of all
i think however there should be a way larger penelty of inbreeding
but nut just by penalizing automatically only
but there should be interface for infinit relation tree tracking of each creature

everytimy you sell a creature, that nodes past is purged.

therefore, with limited barn sizes, you won't be overswarmed by your tree atleast no in first atempt

i also think that the tasks of delivery should be more requiring, say delivering a horse to 
a racetrack, then the quality on the horse depends on how saticified the buyer is, and how likely it is to buy more 
from you

mise has fast metabolism, small size, and high reproductionrate, 

to breed a race of certain type you need breeding penns of correct animal.

at start you pick one pentype, 
then as you grow in economical strenght, you accurie more or larger penns.
