# Ttw total conversion

* War of the commonwealth
* auto loot ( maybe just corpses )
* Linked storage or bank
* Armour quickly degrading
* smarter ai
* burn

Some sort of insentive to explore inside buildings and a increased danger doing so, for example, spawn mainly ghouls in exteriors while raiders spawn in interiors.

Something like, any time entering a cell, set spawn timer, set spawn list, and ignore more global approaches that might be more resources consuming.

Maybe armoured ghouls is a more suitable actor, and then let towns be fortified safe heavens.
