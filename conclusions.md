the phone should access at least currently opened sessions,

the phone is locked to a browser that does the syncing for it.

the sessions need to be aggregated to be lightweight, for example, only currently opened sessions on other pcs. not history.

browsing on the phone should some how be transparent for the other browsers.

ultimate solution would probably be to have separate browser icons per external computer.

and that that icon only sync tabs from that computer to the specific browser instance on the phone.
if a tab is opened on the pc, a bookmark should be scene on the phone. if a tab is opened in the phone browser it should be treated as a bookmark to be synced back to the pc.

do we need to make our own browser for this or can xsync help with this?
