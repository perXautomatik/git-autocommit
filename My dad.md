## i don't want my dad to only relate to me as a the child.
	f√∂r att skydda mit innre barn
		dad need to relate to me 
			not as a kritical parent
	
	* as the child 
		* dad has duty
		* dad has expectations
		* dad has no inherent need to relate to me as a grownup

## for the sake of making dad relate to me as a grownup
	dad needs to learn whom i am today
		this is cruicial
			he can't relate to something he's not aware of
	dad need to shed some of his preconsived ideas and expectations
		this is obeusly a hard nut to crack as he might not admit that this exceptations is already there.
	dad might not accept whom i am
		then time is the only option

## there is always degrees of adaption between two indeviduals
	however, if my level of adaption is to large compared to my dads adaption, then we return to our initial problem
	
## dad is probably not aware of the degree of adation i make
		neether is there any reason to trye to quantify 
		nor any reason to dwell on this
		
## the only thing we can do is to start drawing lines	
		line drawing includes 
			stoping meatings at the moment






if dad can not change his relation to me
	then contact can not be maintained
