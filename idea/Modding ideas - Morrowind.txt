alchemy arrow combine
there is already offensive alchemy where you make arrows with alchemical effect from ingridients, i only want to ad already made potions to arrows, as there effect even if small is still an improvment of the old arrows.

* bartering with random npc's as long as they like you enough
	might be already fixed by mod, we'll see

* helpers have weight indicators so you know if they're encumbered or not

* Sleepers should not answere to threats, nor charming, they shouldn't have the dialoge options like regular citisens and only things that's specificly related to them, like dagoth ur, red mountain, dummer, neverthen, vampires etc.

* Gladiator fights shouldn't be with your current gear, neather any starting mana, you start with one potion of mana, one potion of health and one wepon of choice, possibly a sheild

you get it back when come back out, diying only take you back to the game arranger.

the gladiators shouldn't have as expensive gear as ebony axe or ordinator armour, more common stuff, and extremely potent scrolls that should be used under the fight so that the loot isn't too valuable

* bring braintraining into the grinding, to make a jump, out of combat, complete a braintraing test, like solving math, the quicker you answere, the more points of training you get, 
	cat a spell solve a puzzle, how ever, regardless of your solving speed you can't generate more than double the training value, 

* imagine "entering training mode", the character start training which skill you chose by picking an action, for each automated point you answere questions, braingames, errors doesn't remove any point but you don't gain any eather 


* folovers and quest givers takes time on how long it takes for you to complete a quest, and there liking drops if they seem to want you doing something urgently.

* energy sheild like diablo 2 that is mana kost for life
* spell like effect of dungeon seigh 1, convert all objects in radius to gold, or divide mana on party or share life on party.

* kajits/argonians discussion topics & other information should be gamatically different accordingly to ther races

se weight for each "filter" in your inventory screen

* grey out subjects you've already read when talking with npcs, so you might get a hint when an npc might have something new to say

* autopilot, explore map of save 1 as long as save 2 > save 1.
	could probably be done by extracting mapp data from savefile one and two, then as the computer get hold of the controls it starts walking in any general driection
	it saves it's progress after say 30 sec or other interval, it compares map with save one and two, if no difference was done for map 1 during start and after test run one
	halt with error, if progress bin done, change direction towards next largest undiscovered feild, so the only thing the computer does is spinning the characters arround and engagin autowalk
	saves, compares the savefiles mapdata, turns the character in the game, starts walking etc etc.

* if you pay alm for the poor(other quests) out of your own pocket or inventory, you should be able to go to the actual questplace and require the things you payed for them,
* if an npc catch you stealing, they shouldn't instantly attac but depending on there disposition dropp points in it if any then when reaching zero attacking you.

* make npcs call for help from other thugs in the area or conecting area.
*flame atronaches shouldn't die from standing on lava.
* should instantly drown in water though.

* larger diversity between the different armours of each tier, for example imperial armour could be protective but easly break or dwemer etc.
* price of enchanted items variy depending on the charges it have left

* shouldn't orcish weponry and armours be more widely spread if they're indeed the best currently produced
	shouldn't important people wear the best defenisive armour money can buy, glass deadric etc.
	sure the imperial is all decorative and shit, but why should only the maincharacter wear this gear.
	glass armour is produced, so that should aslo be more comonly worn than dwemer

* dont pause the game as you enter inventory

* enchant smith, like that diablo clone, give enchanted items for free to it and it can make more and more powerful items, when reaching maximum player made items, that is past constant effect 
it does items with negative effects pluss strenghts beond player made items, like the boots of blinding speed

* wearing more expensive clothes increases your personality, that is, if you look rich people will think higher of you
* "candy boots" made by material that breaks in water and or warmth, that requires special repearing methods but has abnormaly high enchanting properties
* your own stronghold key
* Manage and maintain your strongholds

*Balance all armours over the expansions as well, deadra armours should be superior, orc should be superior manmade armour and dwermer should be somewhere inbetween does, nordic and what ever expansion introduced should be belove that
even if that means you wont find orcish any dremora items before your in the expansions.
* wearing heavy armour etc it's speed reduction should be reflected in your some stats somewhere.

* items you sell merchants gets randomly distrebuted among npcs in the same cell whom will don this items and in return sell there own representavte  items. though if a char does not wear any heavy armour helmet or does not have proficenci in heavy armour or doezs not wear any armour or wepons at all normally, then that char will not be distrubuted other than possibly potions and or alchemy ingridients.
* items can aswell be replaced with interiors of houses etc.

* encumberance should be evidently reducing your acrobatics, climbing a steap hill should be easier if you throw of your gear, 
* race diversity, instead of btbs reduction of the skill gain for misc major and minor skills, the race should differ, that is a argonian will be able to learn any dicipline of weponry but it will due to it's nature, learn spear quicker, so basicly each dicipline not mentioned in the lore of a creature should have a lvling dissadvantage while and the oposti for does mentioned.	

* darkisle reborn in morowind
	the pause, speedup and ultraspeed button
	the liedown sneaking method
	the crafting and harvesting methods
	some monsters
	the runesystem
			

* instead of making homemade potions worth nothing, i'd rather make the resulting potion worth less (% equals to alchemy skill) than the base ingridients
	silly according to me that you as a player exell in every fucking skill in the universe, so why should one ever be able to make better potions than the normal sellers
	*merchants could sell potions of of there own making with the value the player could normally sell them for
	as if the merchant has alchemyskill 100 and the same set of equpment/ingridients they're selling
	*current system still nulify the purpus of buying potions, so eather downtuning of the alchemyskill or increased potential of sold potions is requrired
