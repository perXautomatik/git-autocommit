fight monstsers in waves,

enter a arena, that spawn monsters

endlessly or rather harder as you lvl

kill 20 of something, the stronger your party get. the stronger the enemy

mixed parties aswell

mixed with bosses as well

pauses between waves so you get chance to heal

5 waves and portal opens

the portals just put you in random room with same script that's increasingly dificult depending on your char lvls

greate for script evalation.

store every third chamber?

could be every store in the game, divided over the course of your lvling

should you be able to go back to buy later from an old vendor?
