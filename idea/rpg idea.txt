Writing: Pain academy

as aspiering new soldiers enter the finer schools for combat training 
they're borrowed a ring each.
this ring unites with the wearers flesh and will regenerate even the grimest wound to the wearer.

as the soldiers practise they're allowed lethal force against there commrads, teaching each of them the pain they should avaid without losing the life in the process of learing.


"extra lard in the porridge, you will need all energy you can get for todays lessons, the rings hungers the same lifeforce as you do, better have some spare than run short in mid combat."
