hovering over an item should give similar overlay as in vanilla diablo 3
that is green value in procentage for increase and decrease of values
only different that you get a a comparing window for each skill which is affected
for example, static strike would increase life per hitt rate as an effect per attackspped
due to it doing atleast 2 hitts it's increase in healingrate is double than heavystrike

effective healthpoint 
effective healtpoint against chaos

healing is represented in % Maximumlife/second + per oponent hitt/second + life per kill

life steal should point out where weather or not it reaches it's cap/second

hovering over a gem "increasing burning damage" should point out aprox dmg increase if counting in
skills that deal fire dmg and crit/burnchanse
