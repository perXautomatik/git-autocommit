library cleanup

do to the itunes library java api
and the last.fm java api
visually comparing albums from server and from computer should be rely simple.

you pick for example artist. in some dropdown menue

last.fm sort all artists and show pictures of the shit in a falling down list
musicbee or itunes library xml lists corresponding artists on the right with possible album count

right there easy to see what you might need to download more from etc

you click on any artistpicture to see albumcomparing between last.fm and xml 

yeat again easy to see what needs to be downloaded

you click on any album that's represented on both sides
you can now see witch tracks both sides has, and eventual spelling mistakes, 
klicking on a song allows you to copy it's spelling over to the other sides corresponding representation

wich eather means removal and rescrobbling or rewriting tagdata of files

here you can also see if playcount matches between offline and online files,
in case of differentiation; spelling might keep mbee to fail to update etc.
