bg when leaving bg1 through the dutches palace:
"... we have handpicked traveling companiens for you, we're afraid we can't bring more than them with you. i suggest you say good by to your friends and tell me when you are ready"

move jaheira & khalid
move minsc & dynaheir
move imoen

to the palace.

the gear that all this characters have on them should be the gear imon mention in the beguining of the dungeon, 

this items should - if they're uniqe be impossible to find on it's original possitions, as they actually in the possitions of the heros, regardless imported or not.

the items should be subtracted from there original places and put in random merchants arround akathla


in an bg world enhanced menue pick char file instead of save game,
 choece any saved character from any game, say bg 1, ice wind 2, throne of baal.
 pick game, that is icewind dale, req lvl > 1, or bg 2 req lvl > 8, or icewind dale 1 heart of fury mode, req lvl > 14 etc.
move parties or partymember between games
you could basicly play with your weeker leftover npcs from a bg1 save in a fresh new party in icewind dale1, when you feel finished with that, you can then move them back into same save, then with collected gear and xp of icewind dale 1's progress.

the new menue could be reealy snazzy!
