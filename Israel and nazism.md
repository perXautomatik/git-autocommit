1:33

welcome everyone good afternoon good evening good morning wherever you are in this world it's your host Danny hi Fong

1:39

and as you can see we are doing a special Sunday live stream I am joined

1:45

by renowned rapper journalist and activist low key he's also the host of

1:52

the Watchdog you can find his Twitter and the link to his program in the video

1:58

description uh welcome back to the show loky I always enjoy our conversations

2:04

how are you I'm as okay as can be Danny thank you very much for having me I

2:09

really appreciate the platform and it's always great to connect with your

2:15

viewers of course of course and definitely understood uh that you are as

2:20

well as can be expected uh I I share that sentiment so let's talk about let's

2:27

maybe begin with uh Israel's massive us and UK backed and

2:35

and uh uh supported propaganda apparatus now the big news has been that Candace

2:42

Owens despite being months late to the Gaza situation the Gaza genocide as well

2:48

as being very mild hearted on the issues

2:54

to say the least uh she's been ousted by someone who you have done some work in

3:00

uncovering uh their connections to this massive Machinery that Israel has at its

3:08

disposal Ben Shapiro so maybe you can talk about this kind of dark web of

3:14

misinformation that Ben Shapiro represents misinformation I should say and how it fits within Israel's ability

3:24

to get away with these crimes against humanity and this genocide that's going on right now in

3:30

Gaza well Israel has established networks of journalists that it works

3:37

with it has as has been seen in the case of CNN where you saw Mark Thompson the

3:44

well-known former head of the BBC well known for his pro-israel starts his

3:49

close relationship with Ariel Chiron regularly took pro-israel uh decisions

3:55

at the BBC then went into CNN and continued with similar um pushes you've

4:02

seen Sky News fire um a presenter or at least take her off air at behest of the

4:09

Israeli government and all of this is just the tip of the iceberg there's a

4:14

plethora of operations being launched to uh subjugate different media platforms

4:21

all the time by Israel and its proxies around the world but in the case of Ben Shapiro you have an interesting

4:28

convergence here of the Independent Media sphere being hijacked by

4:37

pro-israel interests and I am really not being uh factious or exaggeratory when I

4:45

would say that Ben Shapiro is essentially an Israeli military asset

4:51

and I'll explain how I make such an assertion because I'm not making it lightly now to start with we look at

4:58

this company which has just got rid of Candice Owens and her last episode gave

5:04

an indication that she was planning on filming another episode so it certainly

5:10

wasn't something that she had an awareness of before the filming of her last episode at the company so that

5:18

implies that it's not just a simple ending of relationship or her being free

5:24

there is a an ideological reason behind her being pushed out of

5:30

the company now the daily wire is funded by

5:35

expressvpn which is very uh important and massive company in terms of internet

5:42

usage the express VPN the sole owner of it is Cape Technologies Now cape

5:48

Technologies is owned by Israeli billionaire Teddy saggi who donates Millions for the transport of Israeli

5:56

Soldiers the CEO the current CEO of Cape technology Oles which funds the daily

6:01

wire is Ido Erman who is a veteran of

6:07

the Israeli intelligence duv Dean unit that is the very unit that ran into the

6:12

hospital engine disguised as Palestinians and assassinated uh several

6:17

people there the duv Divan is an Infamous uh unit of the Israeli military

6:23

and essentially when you look at the trajectory of Ben Shapiro's career far from being a a Grassroots expression of

6:32

organic ground swell as an independent journalist what you actually have is a

6:38

long line of billionaires who have funded his uh push which I believe is a

6:45

psychological operation that works lock in step with Israeli objectives but also

6:52

and this is a more interesting aspect of it with the US government especially under the uh the the Trump years

7:00

now before the founding of the daily wire Ben Shapiro was funded by Robert

7:06

schillman a tech billionaire on the board of the friends of the IDF now that

7:11

is the largest organization which funnels hundreds of millions of dollars

7:16

every year from the United States directly into the Israeli occupation forces now Ben Shapiro was a shillman

7:24

fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center David Horowitz of course Ren

7:29

Israel lobbyist bullying students across the United States on University campuses

7:35

now at the same time that Ben Shapiro was a shillman fellow Tommy Robinson was also a schillman fellow at the David

7:41

Horwitz Freedom Center now Tommy Robinson is the well-known British islamophobe now according to Lucy Brown

7:48

who was a former employee of Tommy Robinson he was receiving £10,000 a year

7:53

at a time when 10,000 sorry £10,000 a month at a time when £10,000 was about

8:00

between $16 to $20,000 a month so if Robinson and Shapiro were receiving the

8:08

same kind of wage from schilman who was at the same time on the board of the

8:13

friends of the IDF then we have some kind of picture of where Shapiro's earnings were from his role at that time

8:21

however now when you're looking at an operation like the daily wire you are talking about uh at least tens of

8:28

millions is is Flowing uh through that organization partly from subscribers but

8:34

also from funders like cape Technologies now Shapiro and the co-founder of the

8:40

daily wire Jeremy BR boing actually helped set up another very popular and

8:46

well-known YouTube channel Prager University now Prager University is the brainchild of Dennis Prager who is a

8:54

well-known open Israel lobbyist now when Ben Shapiro and Jeremy Bing were working

9:00

on Prager University they worked directly under Marissa Strait who was a

9:06

veteran of Israeli unit 8200 Military Intelligence now that is the unit of the

9:12

Israeli military which surveils Palestinian uh electronic communications

9:18

and really in the revolution that actually a silent Revolution led by the Netanyahu government in

9:25

2012 whereby Israel sold itself as the star up nation and you had a a a real

9:33

flowing of uh unit 8200 alumni into

9:38

private companies around the world that is how you get Black Cube that is how you get the NSO Group which founded

9:44

Pegasus um which came up with Pegasus spy wear on people's phones unit 8200

9:50

was exported around the world so really when you look at particular units in the Israeli military like the tpot like the

9:57

duv dean like the 8200 like the 8 1 these are considered to be the the the

10:04

pride of this um state which you know they say Most states have a military but

10:10

Israel is a military with a state that is certainly um the way that it has

10:15

functioned and like I said 2012 marked a turning point because a lot of these unit 8200 alumni were then inserted not

10:23

only setting up private companies but into private companies now Ben Ben

10:28

Shapiro has constantly positioned himself as delivering the propaganda

10:34

necessary to achieve particular objectives for Israel's um policies so

10:41

for example he has an article which was online in 2003 which reads in the

10:48

following way if you believe Israel has a right to exist then you must allow

10:53

Israel to transfer the Palestinians and Israeli Arabs from Judea and Samaria that's what they call the West Bank Gaza

11:00

and Israel proper time to stop being squeamish transfer is not genocide now

11:06

that article has been wiped from the internet but we have the archive of that article and where it was published so

11:14

people are free to see it on my Twitter but when you see what's happening in

11:19

Gaza when you see the statements that are coming out of Israeli political

11:24

figures Israeli military figures Israeli settle settler leaders they're all

11:29

talking about the depopulation and the expulsion of the Palestinians what's happening now is an extension of the

11:36

plan dallet that was applied in 1984 it's an extension of what n

11:43

described in his wonderful book The expulsion of the Palestinians of course it's wonderful because it's written so

11:49

well and it's researched so well but not because of the content but this is the main stay of the Zionist movement uh

11:56

genocidal uh depopulation of Palestine and constant War of Attrition against

12:03

the indigenous population now in the early days of the daily wire and this is why we have to keep understanding that

12:10

Ben Shapiro has been constantly Reliant upon billionaires invested in uh in all

12:18

manner of Industry so for example the early days of the daily wire millions of dollars flooded into the organization

12:26

from the fracking billionaires the Wilks Brothers now The Wil brothers are also deeply invested in something called The

12:31

Liberty Council which has a stand with Israel campaign where they would host Netanyahu as a speaker and of course

12:38

take people to occupied Palestine to Marvel at Israel but there's another

12:44

aspect of what Ben Shapiro does which brings in the United States and you have

12:49

to understand that we currently have operating a trilateral security state

12:56

which is the uh the complete immersion and the the complete

13:04

um welding of Britain the United States and Israel and that's a security

13:10

relationship that's not on the basis of the political sphere that's what happens military to Military Intelligence Agency

13:17

to intelligence agency the part where one begins in the other ends is almost

13:22

impossible to tell now and it has grown more and more over these years so this is where you have an interesting aspect

13:29

aspect of the bench air project because the Chief Operating Officer of the daily wire today is none other than John Lewis

13:36

who is a Former Intelligence analyst in the US Marine Corp what we also know is

13:42

that the daily wi has employed previously a former US military intelligence officer by the name of

13:48

Wesley Schmidt in customer service analytics that means looking at the

13:54

information which they glean from their users and their viewers and their

13:59

customers what type of information do they have access to it's not really clear but the way the internet functions

14:06

is a lot of people's um information is being passed over to uh places that they

14:14

may uh donate to or subscribe to or use regularly now the interesting aspect is

14:21

when Jordan Peterson is brought into this fold because one of his earliest if not his first video for the daily wire

14:28

was a Abraham's Accords inspired message to Muslims it was called message to

14:34

Muslims and it was a very crude and cheap way for Jordan Peterson to display

14:42

his ignorance for one but essentially what he was trying to do was um

14:49

minimize this conflict of asymmetric military power between the imposition of

14:56

Zionism on people of the region and essentially what Zionism is is the

15:01

continual attempt to fit a square into a circle you're talking about a place that

15:07

has a particular demographic makeup which has naturally developed across um

15:13

the last uh few hundreds of years and Israel is attempting to artificially

15:20

produce a new demographic um equation and in order to do that it has to launch

15:27

genocidal uh war on genocidal war against the Palestinians but also regular air strikes against people of

15:35

the region now the interesting part we have here is the same day that Jordan Peterson after signing a contract worth

15:42

millions of dollars with the daily wire as I'm sure Candace Owens contract was probably worth with them but you don't

15:48

know for sure Shapiro published an interview with ARA lightstone now ARA lightstone held a

15:56

position in the US government which very few people even know exist exists that position is the US

16:04

Special Envoy for economic normalization what what does that what is that job so

16:10

that job is is that person is tasked with normalizing economic relations

16:18

between Israel and the UAE bahin Sudan Koso and Morocco now lightstone was on

16:25

Shapiro's podcast talking about the wonderful achievement of the Abraham Accords but lightstone is somebody that

16:32

also described himself as a friend of Ben Shapiro now according to the

16:38

Jerusalem Post lightstone uh plays an instrumental role in the big strategic

16:44

moves that have taken place along the US Israel axis particularly the series of

16:49

normalization and peace deals that have come about in recent months so Israel has

16:55

always um excelled at being able to Out Source what it wants to the United

17:01

States to Britain and now also more and more to some of these states that were mentioned in that Abraham Accords

17:09

normalization process and just so we're clear where the nor where the Abraham Accords has led to regionally so

17:16

regionally you have the axis of resistance which you see in Lebanon you

17:21

see in Yemen you see in Iraq you see in Iran and on the other side you have the axis of assistance now the axis of

17:28

assistance just so we're clear it's not simply the Jordanian army shooting down

17:34

Rockets fired from Iraq towards Tel Aviv it's not simply Jordan Saudi and the UAE

17:42

providing a landbridge as an alternative to Goods being delivered to the uh Port

17:47

of elat by the Red Sea via the Red Sea what it actually is is for instance the

17:53

edge Group which is a UAE Arms company owned by the state of the U us

17:59

that that company that state-owned company is a part owner of Highlander

18:07

aviations which manages Israel's airspace yeah that is the fruit of the Abraham Accords that we're talking about

18:14

for which Shapiro has attempted to provide the sort of Ambience and and try

18:20

and convert people to its cause what else are we talking about we're talking about Saudi Arabia through the Jared

18:26

kushna founded Affinity Partners which kushna claimed very clearly this

18:33

organization exists to create an investment Corridor between the gulf and

18:39

Israel yeah so putting Gulf money into Israel but what's one of the companies

18:45

the Affinity Partners which was founded by the Saudis and Jared kushna what's one of the companies it owns one of the

18:51

companies it owns is a schlomo group now the schlomo group is an Israeli vehicle

18:56

company which has been equipping several units in the Israeli military namely the

19:01

shaag unit which we will get into a little bit later on in the show particularly with regards to a shif so

19:08

you're this was what the Abraham Accords was about it was about creating a trench

19:15

for states in the region to fight alongside Israel against the will of the

19:22

vast majority of people in the region and the what what is considered to be

19:28

the weakest point the most vulnerable pressure point in the global South today

19:33

is considered to be Gaza and so what you're doing is you're raining down the full m of the collective Global North

19:41

Canada Germany the United States Britain Israel on the backs of the poorest

19:47

people in the world in Gaza as a demonstration to the rest of the global

19:53

South that we can get away with this and we will do this to you if you get to

20:05

uppy yeah I mean uh everything that you said is is so

20:10

important uh given what we know about uh just you know

20:18

Israel in the United States and the UK together now with these Gulf country

20:23

I think this is a good point with the Abraham ACC course there were some who were trying to advocate for this saying

20:30

well the Abraham Accords will create peace it'll normalizing Israel is not

20:36

like just normalizing what it does it's normaliz it's it's it's you know going along with the UN and and and

20:42

normalization diplomacy but everything that you said here and given the fact that top Zionist propagandists like Ben

20:50

shapir are advocating for it seems to indicate that uh the Abraham Accords even though they haven't even been

20:56

signed everything leading up to them has essentially led to uh an attempt

21:03

somewhat successful to uh uh in terms of at least the most compliant uh Regional

21:10

States uh surrounding Palestine to get them to basically do Israel's bidding

21:15

and to be okay with it and to benefit from it to some degree at least when it comes to to the regimes I mean

21:22

absolutely what people need to understand about this talk about will the Saudis normalize with Israel will

21:28

they or won't they the Saudis have already normalized with Israel and I'll describe two major ways very very

21:34

consequential ways in which the Saudis have normalized with Israel so number one you have the Israeli intelligence

21:41

firm celebrite which is headed by alumni of unit 8200 Saudis have hacked the phones of

21:49

their own citizens using this private Israel intelligence company when Jamal

21:54

kashaki was killed by the Saudi government his phone was hacked with Pegasus

22:01

spyware from NSO group and we know actually the NSO group rather than being

22:07

an independent private company it is an arm of the Israeli government that the

22:13

information which is procured from these people's devices through Pegasus spyware is actually seen by NSO group employees

22:21

you had for example Sheri Blair who's on the board ethical advisor to NSO group

22:26

inform one of the princesses of Dubai that her phone was being hacked by her husband now if NSO group has no access

22:32

to what Pegasus is gathering then how would Sheree Blair know that so what you're talking about is essentially the

22:39

functions of saudi's both saudi's external and intelligence um agencies

22:45

external and intelligence a and internal intelligence agencies are actually in some cases being outsourced to Israeli

22:54

intelligence companies that are umbilically connected to the Israeli government so it's happened

23:00

normalization has already happened it's just the extent of which is not clear and the ability for Israel to use it in

23:07

PR is at this stage limited because the agreement has to remain secret and the

23:14

exact components of that agreement are are also

23:20

secret yeah yeah I mean uh good points and very very important now let's talk

23:27

about the besieged I mean I had you on the show not too long ago when alifa was once

23:35

again in the news um in in what's called Northern Gaza although I do find the

23:41

carving up of Gaza geographically to be quite strange given its size and um the

23:48

fact that doing so talks about it as a battlefield essentially rather than a place where people live and are and are

23:55

literally being besieged and genocided but nonetheless Le we do have what Israel is calling a

24:03

raid of alifa and the the reports coming

24:08

out of the humanitarian the human cost of this is absolutely brutal and I I

24:14

can't even repeat some of the things that Israel has been doing but uh nonetheless uh there has been uh quite a

24:23

lot of Civilian casualties and harm but also I wanted to get your opin on where

24:29

Israel's socalled military objectives really are given the fact that uh you

24:35

know I follow almadine the Lebanese media I follow their reports their breaking reports coming out of Gaza and

24:42

it seems that Israel is still embattled with Palestinian resistance forces in

24:47

the north yet all we hear about is the South and when is there going to be an

24:53

incursion on Rafa for another massive Slaughter of pal Ians there so could you

25:00

talk about what exactly is going on here in alifa as well as just uh where Israel

25:06

stands here because on the one hand there's a whole lot of violence going on a whole lot of terrorizing of the

25:12

population and at the same time it seems like they are failing to suppress or

25:17

what they claim to be doing and what they claim is the goal is to suppress the resistance they seem to be failing quite dramatically on that end it what

25:24

what's your take and what have you uh what have you found on this matter well let's start with shif shif the root

25:32

of the word is healing and it's a root which then becomes a mha which is the

25:38

word for hospital in Arabic um and there's three reasons that has been

25:44

targeted so obsessively by the Israelis not to say that all other hospitals in

25:49

Gaza have not been targeted but as shifat holds a particular significance to Israel and I'll explain it so number

25:56

one that hospital is older than the Zionist entity it was built in

26:02

the early 40s so unlike other hospitals in gam which were built through the

26:07

larges of Gulf governments at different points this hospital is old and it is a

26:15

a real symbol of a Palestinian presence which precedes uh Zionist colonialism

26:22

and sett colonialism in Palestine the second reason Israel is so obsessed with

26:27

a shifa is that when Israel occupied Gaz it treated aifa as a military base it built

26:35

a military bunker under a shifa it wasn't the Palestinians it was the Israelis and so they if if if you're

26:42

Hammer everything looks like a nail to Israel they cannot reconcile the concept

26:47

of alifa as a civili a civilian location because their entire Society is

26:52

militarized because they are a militarized society they do not perceive it as as possible that AA is actually a

27:02

hospital number one I mean also they want to arise people so it's not just simply a matter of attacking military

27:08

targets Israel is trying to crush the mere fabric of what it means to be

27:13

Palestinian it is a a deep it's um it's a Buffalo Bill syndrome it's about

27:20

killing and wearing the skin of your victims Buffalo Bill who of course is uh

27:26

the the the the one of of the well-known figures and and and stars and main

27:32

characters of the uh the the the famous film uh featuring uh Anthony Hopkins and

27:40

Buffalo Bill used to kill people and wear their skin and essentially Israel

27:46

attempts to do that with the Palestinians and it doesn't just manifest in ways like the duv dean unit which literally disguise themselves as

27:53

Palestinians in some cases the duvan unit they called them in Arabic these

28:00

people will infiltrate Palestinian communities for years on end and even intermar with

28:05

Palestinians and and there Israel spies and and so this Buffalo Bill syndrome

28:11

manifests in numerous ways the other point about is that a sniper

28:19

from the the military wing of filmed himself shooting and his

28:28

Israeli soldier from the shaag unit um a week or so ago now that operation was

28:35

very significant because it was the shaag unit which initially raided ASAT

28:41

the first time around and so Israel has an obsession with Revenge now when we

28:47

look at some of the horrific details which are emerging from Ed shifa and we

28:53

hear for example that there has been reports and the witnesses have been

28:59

named and this is a key difference between the reports following October

29:04

the 7th of this nature and the reports coming out of Gaza you have had

29:10

Palestinians going on record and stating their names as witnessing Israeli

29:15

soldiers not only raping women within the confines of alifa but also taking

29:22

families and forcing them to watch while they do that in addition to that you

29:28

have the cases of pregnant women being uh or at least a report of a pregnant

29:34

woman 5 months pregnant who that act was carried out upon her um within the

29:42

presence of her family members including children and spouse but we also have to

29:48

contextualize how and why Israeli soldiers would do such a thing yes there's been reports of the same thing

29:54

happening in Israeli prisons in the West Bank to male prisoners yes I personally

30:02

heard the testimony when I interviewed her of ah Tamimi when she as a child was

30:08

taken prisoner by the Israeli military and she was put in a bus alongside adult

30:14

Israeli convicts who who who assaulted her sexually assaulted her in her words

30:20

they groped at her there's there's this is an obsession within the Israeli milit

30:28

Ary uh mentality and it's also even deeper than that the current chief Rabbi

30:35

of the Israeli military Rabbi Colonel Al Kim said the following when asked he

30:41

said although intercourse with a female Gentile is very grave it was permitted

30:46

during wartime under the conditions it stipulated out of consideration for the soldiers difficulties he wrote and since

30:54

our concern is the success of the collective in the war the Torah permitted soldiers to satisfy

31:01

the evil urge under the conditions it stipulated for the sake of the collective success now I'm not stating

31:08

that to say that that is a view across people of a particular faith I'm saying

31:14

that the particular individual who is in charge of the religious practice of the

31:19

Israeli military has previously given his permission for soldiers to take part

31:25

in that activity it's widely reported across the Israeli media we are not

31:31

creating something out of nothing so where does this mentality come from which says it is okay for soldiers to

31:38

treat Palestinians in alifa hospital in that way well you have something

31:44

pointing to the very top of the Israeli military now in terms of your other question which was about the overall

31:53

objective now how you measure uh victory

31:58

in a war is not simply annihilating everyone you see and

32:05

everyone knows that everyone's saying that okay you also have to have your

32:12

ideas taken to be convincing to the widest amount of people and what Israel

32:18

has done with the way that it has performed this genocidal campaign in

32:25

Gazza is it has alienated as we may get on to later in the interview it's

32:31

alienated major allies it's alienated I mean not the new allies of the Abraham

32:36

Accords the regional Partners but it's alienating the global South you have

32:42

across Latin America leaders who have expelled the Israeli Ambassador who are

32:47

speaking in very harsh terms about Israel you have across Africa and across

32:55

and across Asia different governments that are now perceiving Israel in a way

33:00

that frankly before with the Diplomatic setup that they had they weren't able to

33:06

but today they're looking at Israel as a a truly exceptionally evil entity more

33:16

people in the world are enemies of Zionism than ever before more people in

33:21

the world perceive Zionism to be a genocidal ideology and they see the

33:27

direct material manifestation of that in Gaza and actually they are discrediting

33:33

their allies in a way that they have never before been discredited if you look at PR for example the United States

33:40

and Britain are so much better than Israel they would carry out crimes but try and wrap them up in language of

33:47

democracy and Israel at this stage now has been able to uh build a situation

33:54

where Egypt is constructing camps on the edge of God AA to accept the Palestinians when they flow out the US

34:01

with golf money by the way and and and a company that is uh staffed by former US

34:08

military and intelligence and is actually sending soldiers to help construct a port which will be a key

34:16

fact a key point of the depopulation of Gaza this is not looked upon kindly this

34:22

is a disaster for the us around the world they are more discredited than

34:28

they have ever been and actually this is a key chapter in the decline of us

34:36

Global Primacy Global uh dominance this will be seen historically when it is

34:43

correctly historicized as one of the final steps in the US domination of the

34:49

world it will be looked back on as this is what was allowed to happen this type

34:54

of antihuman behavior was per missible under us stewardship of the global

35:02

economy and people will look back and say it's a mark of shame on all who were

35:07

involved in it yeah please talk more about this port

35:13

because when it was announced several weeks ago uh my eyebrows immediately raised before any of the details came

35:19

out it was the B Administration sending yeah we're going to send a thousand troops to Gaza they're going to build a

35:26

a pier this Port off the coast and uh

35:31

this comes as you know the United Nations has been sounding the alarm about imminent starvation for uh uh you

35:40

know upwards of 30 40 50% of the population in

35:46

Gaza uh I know that there's more to this now there's reports about a contractor

35:53

uh being responsible for the port as well as as you said I'll terior motives

35:58

could you speak more on that well this is just another way in which Israel is

36:04

able to Outsource its needs to the United States and also the gulf

36:10

countries because it's from the Gulf that this money is being put up to build

36:15

this port there's several different ports being uh constructed at the same time and peers being built at the same

36:22

time ultimately this is just a way to Mission creep into a situation where

36:29

regularly things will be leaving that uh area of Gaza and it just so happens that

36:36

there is massively valuable uh gold uh gas and oil reserves which major Western

36:44

companies including British Petroleum have signed contracts to extract and so

36:50

really from that perspective Hamas it was considered a major obstacle to that

36:56

plan because when the Palestinian Authority um and Israel were working

37:02

together they had a a contract drawn up for the extraction of those reserves and

37:09

when Hamas were elected and and and Gaza was taken by Hamas it meant that this

37:14

was a um a a a a real impediment to meeting its full potential um as a as a

37:23

place um so both the us and the Israelis

37:29

have a real interest in in in doing that and and so you have this uh this

37:37

particular company by the name of Fogo which is vying for the contract to uh to

37:46

carry out this operation and build the port and then operate the port but Fogo

37:52

as a company is not simply a a well

37:57

meaning um nondescript company that has no background in the US military no

38:05

quite the opposite when you look at who it was founded by and the key figures

38:10

behind it the top two individuals that work for it are actually former um high

38:18

ranking employees of the US military so for example Sam Mundi is uh one of the

38:25

founders he's us Marine Corps Lieutenant General 38 years of active duty as an

38:32

infantry officer in the Israeli military he's the president of Fogo the other

38:38

individual that runs Fogo the vice president is Mick mry who was Deputy assistant Secretary of Defense and 20

38:45

years in the CIA so this is who stands to gain from this operation in Gaza

38:54

there's also been uh pict that have been released and rumors going around that

39:00

part of the construction of one of the peers of Gaza will make use of the

39:06

rubble of houses you know in the interest in the interests of uh being green about this they are trying to use

39:13

it as PR we're using rubble from the houses to build the port and and and these are houses that people haven't

39:19

even been dug out of yet so this is this is the new world that these people want

39:25

they want a new world where this can be to ghettoized populations and we can get away with it

39:32

and we can stick our nose up at the so-called consensus that was reached

39:39

civilization postc World War which meant that when you do carry out these kind of

39:44

operations there's some sort of PR dressing you have to wrap it up in you H it has to be somehow justifiable and

39:51

acceptable to other states of the world but what you have happening at the icj is other states of the world are showing

39:57

that they are absolutely opposed to this but moreover the judges who have come

40:03

from some of the states which are involved in this military campaign are not voting in line with their State's

40:09

policy some of the judges are voting against their State's policy so we're in

40:15

a an unprecedented situation actually which will stand to condemn all who have

40:22

been part of it and even us who have tried but not tried hard enough to stop

40:28

as France fenon said every spectator is either a coward or a traitor and we have

40:35

among those with power in the world today among the rulers of the region

40:41

some of the most cowardly and most traitorous human beings to have ever existed they are standing and watching

40:49

this genocide happen yeah I mean the most astounding I

40:55

mean it's quite astounding isn't it that as there was that there's even a

41:00

conversation about building a port I mean I mean it's astounding to say the least that uh Israel and its backers are

41:08

attempting to greenwash this effort uh Pink washing is quite well known now uh

41:17

uh with regard to how Israel and the IDF paint themselves as lgbtq friendly and

41:24

all of this but to greenwash uh to use uh the catastrophe of uh uh you know of

41:33

climate and and and the environment as as part of their agenda is also just quite sickening but also there's the on

41:41

the just on the surface everything that you said is incredibly important to understand and know about what's underneath this port uh um U being built

41:50

but there's thousands what 7,000 something trucks in Egypt and so you

41:55

talk about the the this Aid being blocked 7,000 TRS full of Aid being blocked the United States dropping Aid

42:01

and killing Palestinians while they do it uh of course Israel massacring Palestinians trying to get Aid and then

42:09

you also have as you mentioned the you call them traitors the actual the national what uh Phenom might call the

42:16

national bis these rulers inside of let's say a country like Egypt who not

42:22

putting up much of a fight around this blocked a so to speak it's just sitting there and uh Israel is being given cart

42:29

blanch to allow this to happen your your reactions to that absolutely and you

42:34

know Israel's um intransigence on the blocking of Aid is actually alienating

42:41

even allies like Britain for example to some extent so you have someone like Alicia Kerns you know Alicia Kerns is

42:49

somebody who is widely believed to be an MI6 asset within British Parliament she

42:55

has some she is somebody that has worked um with both the foreign and the home

43:00

office on quite sensitive issues previously she has led a PR agency that

43:07

had among its clients the US state department and others Alicia Kerns is a person of the British and also the

43:15

anglo-american military establishment now she's currently holding Israel to

43:21

task in a more direct way than we've ever seen from a British political

43:26

figure in fact it was her intervention that got the uh Israeli uh spokesman who

43:34

came from from Britain from Cambridge University um I I forget his second name

43:40

this this uh really absolutely um insufferable idiot she was able to get

43:48

him suspended from his position because he said incorrectly that the United Nations had blocked um the aid going in

43:56

to Gaza so this issue is becoming a really aggravating point and a point of

44:01

difference between you know Britain's military cooperation with Israel is one thing but then you also have in the

44:08

political sphere some type of push back you know Britain has issued 26 arm arms

44:14

licenses to Israel throughout this war it has um for example the R1 Shadow

44:20

plane going over the top of Gaza on an almost daily basis now that is a plane that also specializes in Target

44:27

acquisition we know that the British SAS was supposed to be uh uh getting ready

44:33

to be active in Gaza at the beginning of this campaign and then uh

44:39

something uh was published was uh what they call a a d notice was sent out by

44:46

the British government to journalists which said do not publish any information about SAS activity in Gaza

44:52

why would they do that if there was no SAS activity in Gaza so while you have

44:57

the military Alliance and Britain has a secret military deal with Israel which the details are not known but would

45:04

probably stipulate involvement of each party when hostilities are entered um

45:10

and so even despite that you have those with you know Charlie Herbert ma Major General Charlie Herbert within the

45:16

British military um has now spoken out and is now being demonized um because he's speaking out against Israel Ben

45:22

Wallace the former Minister of Defense in this country who was the Minister of Defense when that deal was signed with

45:28

the Israelis has effectively accused them of war crimes and this is several months ago so there is great disqui even

45:35

among allies who are directly working with Israel now the Canadian Parliament

45:41

has voted for the cessation of armed CS to Israel but also Israel is alienating

45:47

Russia through blocking the aid Russia's looking at this situation and saying we have Aid waiting in Egypt to enter and

45:54

you are not allowing that to happen and actually you know you sent to me this this uh story about Amir Whitman and his

46:02

clip where he's threatening Russia if we want to talk about that I'd be happy to

46:07

yeah yeah let's let's uh let's move now to yeah the global implications

46:14

of uh this this Israeli genocide in Gaza I mean uh of course there's all over the

46:22

news now or at least all over uh especially news coming out of Russia and

46:29

really much of the global South the global majority are all mourning the horrific terrorist attack in crocus

46:36

Concert Hall in Moscow um so yes as you said Amir

46:42

Whitman a lud I guess libertarian party uh lud party libertarian faction

46:49

politician he's going viral once again this was actually back in October 2023

46:55

when he made these comments uh not unironically I guess to RT where

47:01

he said Russia will pay the price for supporting Israel's enemies Israeli weapons should find their way into the

47:06

Ukrainian Army so his argument was that Russia has been as he said supporting

47:12

Nazi people want to commit genocide on the Jews in Israel in so he said this in the interview and he's also been on the

47:19

Kiev post talking about uh kind of connecting these two things that Russia is not only supporting Hamas not only

47:25

supporting resistance but is also um

47:31

supporting uh or or taking part in its own kind of genocide in Ukraine so talk

47:36

about these fra relations because we were speaking before the program about

47:41

you know I I mentioned how Russia has hosted Hamas fat and other Palestinian

47:47

resistance groups quite frequently and and most recently talking about a Unity government so uh Israel has some reason

47:55

I guess to be uh a little perturbed by by by Russia's stance and and Israel has

48:01

indeed been alienating Russia through its actions in Gaza what's your

48:06

assessment of this and yeah let's let's get into the broader implications of what Israel is doing because we have

48:12

that we have the tick tock ban conversation which is not just about China anymore which it was for quite

48:18

some time but now a lot are speculating Israel has a huge hand in pressuring the

48:23

Banning of Tik Tok in the US so I I'll kick it to you okay so it's important to

48:29

understand that him making that statement is not just the irrational ramblings of a dogmatic ideologue in

48:37

actuality one of the first interviews that came from um Hamas leadership was

48:43

Ali Baraka um within a few weeks of the

48:49

Ala flood operation now what he said in that interview had reverberations and he

48:56

claimed that Hamas has Russian licenses to produce bullets for their

49:01

kalashnikovs that they were granted them directly by the Russians it has also

49:07

been claimed elsewhere by Hamas leadership that Russia has promised to

49:12

use the al- AKA flood in its military schools and teach it as a an Innovative

49:19

and original military operation and so then that leads to the decision that was

49:25

made on November 16th where Israeli Banks introdu restrictions on accounts belonging to Russian

49:31

Nationals in line with the EU um instructions following the war in

49:37

Ukraine now you have to remember Russia is also aware that Israel's largest Arms

49:44

Company elbit systems had been arming the Neo-Nazi azov Battalion with tavour

49:50

rifles going back several years we also cannot forget that the top

49:57

of zalinski in Ukraine that pushed him into the position of president was eigor

50:03

Ki who is a Ukrainian Israeli and cypria

50:09

uh Citizen and he was not only the top funer of zelinski in the 2019 election

50:14

but he was also a uh a top funer of the AZ of Battalion and the right sector

50:21

these Nazi groups which zilinski has overseen the complete

50:28

entrenchment of these Neo-Nazi groups into the Ukrainian State well you also

50:34

have to remember on the other side is that mercenaries from the Ukraine forward observations Group which is a US

50:41

military mercenary Group which was set up um by Derek Bales a former US soldier

50:48

who served in Afghanistan he got involved in Ukraine

50:53

through the azov Battalion but where is is the forward observations group fighting now it's fighting with the

51:00

Israeli military against Gaza so there's a very complex relationship here in

51:07

which things are considerably uh delicate we know that following the

51:15

sanctions put on Russia Israel was one of the countries that did not actually

51:21

go along with the sanctions regime you had Roman Abramovich um a Russian

51:27

Israeli citizen who when it came time for him to be sanctioned by Britain and

51:34

the United States what happened was a de facto Israeli State

51:40

organization intervened led by Danny Diane who is the former head of the

51:45

umbrella for all illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank The yeser Count Council he lobbied the us not to

51:53

sanction Roman Abramovich and Roman abramov was not sanctioned you have to remember that Abramovich has pumped over

52:00

a 100 million into settlement building organizations in neighborhoods like

52:05

silwan and Sheikh Jah so an interesting aspect of this point was celebrate which

52:13

is the same Israeli intelligence company that I mentioned before which um hacks

52:19

phones for yes the Saudi government yes the UAE government yes the British

52:24

government and yes unfortunately even the Venezuelan government and the Pakistani government celebrite had a

52:30

presence in Russia before Ukraine IE celebrite was being used by the Russian government to act funds and it pulled

52:36

out off the back of Ukraine so you are seeing the the the the decoupling of

52:44

some of these major relationships and working business relationships another

52:49

thing that Israel ceased doing post October 7th was ceased giving for

52:54

warning of its strikes in Syria to the Russians because previously it had been

53:00

doing that Israel has of course bombed Syria a thousand times across the last

53:06

uh five to uh well no 10 years across the last 10 years so what you're also

53:13

seeing break apart even more so is Israel now taking a far more hostile

53:20

stance towards China and Tik Tok is just one part of it the Israelis claim that

53:26

they found Chinese weapons in Gaza whether that's true or not I do not know

53:32

but what I do know is that governments like the Chinese and the Russian government unlike governments in the EU

53:40

and Japan H they have not designated Palestinian resistance organizations as

53:46

terrorist organizations the Palestinians have the right under UN resolution

53:53

3246 to resist foreign occup ATI um with many forms of resistance

54:00

including armed resistance decolonization at the United Nations is considered to be a universal good it's

54:07

part of the basis of how the global South came to be part of an institution

54:12

like that there's so many states in the world which are products of decolonization and

54:19

P and see and have an affinity see an affinity between themselves and between the Palestinians because they understand

54:26

themselves to be postcolonial uh subjects they understand themselves to

54:31

have emerged from three Opium Wars which absolutely eviscerated Society Colonial

54:38

treachery practiced on an industrial scale and so people are far more likely

54:43

to relate to the Palestinian side of this equation than the Israeli side of the equation especially those that have

54:49

been victims of Western um and anglosaxon uh imperialism and

54:55

colonialism across the past few hundred years but what you have happening with

55:00

Tik Tok and and this is really fascinating here and I think it's important that people have an awareness

55:06

of it the United States claims that Tik Tok may be being used to spy on

55:12

Americans but I will tell you why that is absolutely categorically not

55:18

true following something called project Texas Tik tok's us data is handled by

55:27

Oracle Oracle is the operation of Larry Ellison Larry Ellison is the top funer

55:35

of the Israeli Defense Forces in the history of the friends of the IDF organization Larry Ellison is one of

55:42

Benjamin netanyahu's best friends to the point where he offered Netanyahu the directorship of uh Oracle that's right

55:51

us users data through Tik Tok is handled by Oracle Oracle is a creature of the US

56:00

Israeli bilateral Security State Larry Ellison set it up to service the CIA it

56:07

has former high ranking CIA um directors

56:12

now high at high levels within the company um Oracle and as I said

56:17

Netanyahu was offered the directorship of it but in this situation that we see

56:23

today when following project Tex you had an absolute influx of former

56:30

employees of us intelligence and NATO into the company Tik Tok so for instance

56:36

the content policy lead for Tik Tok Canada Alexander corale is simultaneously the vice president of the

56:43

NATO Association of Canada something that I revealed was the feature policy

56:48

manager Greg Anderson at Tik Tok used to work on psychological operations for

56:53

NATO until 2019 after I published that information he deleted the psychological operations

57:00

aspect of his work for NATO Bo Patterson who works as a threat analyst for Tik tok's trust and safety department

57:06

previously he was a targeting analyst for the CIA Victoria Mulla she used to work for the Department of Homeland

57:12

Security in the White House itself she now works on trust and safety at Tik Tok and there are many many more we have to

57:19

remember that the latest escalation against Tik Tok began in the early stages of gaza's genocide when a

57:26

recording was leaked of Jonathan greenblat the head of the lobby group and spy agency the ADL you know the

57:33

Anti-Defamation League was believed as far back as 1969 by the FBI according to

57:38

internal memo an internal memo in the FBI to be a proxy of the Israeli

57:44

government and he was talking and he said look we have a gen Z problem and we have a Tic Tac a Tik Tock problem we

57:51

need to work on this and so now you have the US Congress f in pushed by Israel

57:58

and uh us neocon warhawks to say to Tik

58:04

talk either you are purchased by a us company within six months or you are banned from the company I mean this is

58:10

gangsterism in its clearest and purest form and so what you now have is the

58:17

pro-israel former Trump official he was the Secretary of the Treasury Steve minuchin is gathering investors under

58:24

his umbrella to buy a Tik Tok well we're taking full circle here because off the back of the Abraham Accords Steve

58:31

minuchin set up a group of investors and investment Fund in order to channel

58:37

money from the Gulf into Israel and who was one of the investors that he called upon Yosi Cohen the former director of

58:44

Mossad so you have a Mossad linked Trump official seeking to buy titop to

58:51

continue this push to take over this place in which people are exchanging

58:56

information about Israel's crimes in

59:02

Gaza yeah no I mean it's quite extensive I mean earlier when you were talking about you know China and Russia's

59:09

position I know that China Chinese Envoy was at the icj just recently talking

59:15

about palestine's right to self-defense to Armed struggle under uh international

59:22

law and then you know everything that you're saying about this social media blitz this kind of takeover uh not just

59:30

of Tik Tok but even recently we've seen Instagram there now censoring political

59:35

contents literally where you have to go into your settings and unlimit your

59:41

profiles access to so-called political content uh it's pretty safe to say that

59:47

given how horrific this uh genocide in Gaza has been for the public relations

59:53

of say the Biden Administration in the United States Israel Etc it's no

59:59

coincidence that that is happening now and so uh you know it it really is full

1:00:05

circle where you have this incredible attempt to control information within

1:00:11

the perpetrating the countries the Empire uh while at the same time you

1:00:17

have countries that can't be controlled in the same way China Russia uh really

1:00:22

presenting big problems for the legitimacy of this campaign that the

1:00:28

United States is fully supporting the UK is fully supporting uh with regard to

1:00:33

Israel and its genocide in Gaza so that's even you know we didn't even get

1:00:39

to and maybe final comment the you know the recent ceasefire so-called resolution this time put forward by the

1:00:46

United States after vetoing one two I believe it was three legitimate ceasefire proposals put forward its own

1:00:53

proposal which literally was not a ceasefire I believe it held maybe it's been talking about a few weeks here and

1:01:00

there pause but basically conditioning any kind of very short pause on

1:01:05

essentially the defeat of Palestinian resistance saying that they have to give up all the hostages I mean they're dying

1:01:11

of starvation now anyway from what I'm hearing coming out of Gaza because of

1:01:16

the siege but nonetheless the point here is that you know the United States just

1:01:23

saw Russia and China veto their fraudulent proposal and they were very vocal about why it was fraudulent that

1:01:29

it actually was incredibly one-sided and did not represent in any kind of form of De diplomacy at all so maybe your final

1:01:37

comments on this uh on this question yeah just to say Danny thank you so much

1:01:43

for having me it's always great to talk to you it's always great to talk to you in in this case the US has provided a

1:01:51

constant stream of PR services to Israel throughout this war it's provided them

1:01:57

with ra is a red line obviously this bu time it's provided them with we're

1:02:02

building a port to deliver Aid this buys them time it delivered them the we've tried a ceasefire motion again this buys

1:02:10

Israel time it's simply about threat inflation and deflection um and that's

1:02:17

what the United States has provided to Israel throughout this war and it will go down in history that these were never

1:02:24

well-meaning uh gestures from the United States and the extent of us involvement

1:02:29

from help with targeting from the sending of officers from the US Air Force from Aaron bushnel um killing

1:02:36

himself self-immolating outside the Israeli Embassy and then being smeared

1:02:42

in death um all of the services um that the United States has rendered to Israel

1:02:47

throughout this period will become more and more apparent over time and it will be a mark of Shame on the empire in its

1:02:55

grave yeah and I was just thinking as you were

1:03:00

talking about something I can leave you with that's a little more light-hearted but uh also I think very relevant in the

1:03:08

course of the US complicity and censorship uh of any kind of criticism

1:03:16

to Israel's uh just absolute uh Onslaught uh maybe some of the reasons

1:03:23

why Tik Tok is under Fire is because Clips like this can go really really viral so this this was earlier in 2023

1:03:31

but I I find it hilarious uh we're in Israeli came on to a chat with a couple

1:03:37

of uh Shanghai based Chinese women and here's what here's what they had to say

1:03:42

I'll just leave you on this from Israel are you from China yes Chinese people are disgusting what you

1:03:50

we've been in the restaurant in this ancient High Circle and building the food was

1:03:57

in China there is a saying is a pig cannot appreciate busines what the [ __ ] does a place that

1:04:04

sells fake stuff just just just fake your country is fake if I have Israel on my Visa I can't

1:04:11

even visit out some countries because they don't really accept the

1:04:17

passport so I just want to leave you on that because uh you know sometimes we do

1:04:22

have to laugh a little amidst the the destruction but but uh lowkey thank you so much for for joining today um

1:04:30

appreciate you giving time any any any thing you want to plug or anything like that before you go just support the

1:04:36

Channel people and keep pushing Independent Media keep reading keep writing keep researching whatever we've

1:04:43

done so far on the Palestinian issue is not enough we can and must escalate um

1:04:49

and now is the time where um you know they call Politics the uh the of the

1:04:56

possible well we are now in a stage where the Overton window of what is possible is wider than at any point

1:05:02

previously on the issue of Palestine keep reading keep writing keep researching keep fighting thank you

1:05:09

indeed yes so and make sure you go to um thank you so much for coming on again U

1:05:16

1:06:16

I like to keep the live stream up and I like to uh make clips of it so Loki uh

1:06:23

1:06:59

1:07:11

1:07:16

minutes or so uh maybe put in a one in the chat and I will see how many people

1:07:22

would like me to stay on to do this as well because I want to talk about why

1:07:27

Russia through this uh memory of NATO's

1:07:33

dismemberment of Yugoslavia is so keen on declaring a state of War as it has

1:07:41

there's so many elements to this but we will cover Russia's perspective in particular here for the purposes of

1:07:49

what's been happening uh of late so I got a lot of ones I got a lot of ones

1:07:55

make sure you stick around we still got 2,300 people here uh um so thank you and

1:08:00

I I'll be sure to give shout outs afterward all right we got a lot of people wanting me to stay on to talk

1:08:05

about Yugoslavia so let's do it um talk about Yugoslavia and Russia why Russia

1:08:12

is uh so keen and interested in this War

1:08:18

uh brutal War a historic war and there was an interesting piece recently written in Russian media I think is

1:08:24

worth covering given recent comments so let's get

1:08:37

started on March 24th 1999 nato intervened in a huge way in

1:08:48

Yugoslavia so this bombing campaign lasted 77 days destroyed what was left

1:08:56

of Yugoslavia at the time because the war had been raging for several years before that with NATO's indirect

1:09:02

involvement especially the United States and the destruction of Yugoslavia

1:09:07

is really a story not just in the end of a particular society in the region a

1:09:14

nation in the region that was seen as a problem after the fall of the Soviet

1:09:21

Union seen as a problem by NATO it was one of Nat first campaigns after the

1:09:27

fall of the Soviet Union uh military campaigns and offensive campaign so to

1:09:33

speak and its implications go far beyond just Yugoslavia even though the loss of

1:09:40

Yugoslavia still reverberates across especially the region but the entire

1:09:45

world as a defeat in the attempts of the

1:09:50

global majority to pave their own way out of the dominance and influence of

1:10:00

American hegemony so Russia of course is very interested in this

1:10:07

anniversary of the bombing of Yugoslavia you might ask well why a big reason for this is because

1:10:15

Russia has declared a state of War this is a relatively new assertion it was uh

1:10:21

made on March 22nd just just a day or

1:10:26

less than a day before the horrific crocus attack in Moscow and this state of War has

1:10:34

everything to do with NATO it's everything to do with NATO that's because Russia has declared

1:10:41

it is in a state of War not because it's not trying to wage a special military operation Ukraine and keep the war at a

1:10:48

level keep its military intervention at a level that keeps the door open for

1:10:55

diplomacy Russia has been doing that since the very beginning but it's because NATO is so

1:11:02

directly involved in Ukraine that now we are having NATO member states like

1:11:09

France make direct threats to Russia of

1:11:14

military intervention not unlike what we saw during this period uh when the US

1:11:21

and NATO invaded Yugoslavia so the

1:11:26

history here is very important to Russia so let's look at Russia's perspective on

1:11:34

Yugoslavia they posted this article ruins of Yugoslavia how Russia learned

1:11:40

that NATO poses a threat the US military blocks illegal strikes on Belgrade in

1:11:45

the spring of 1999 forever changed relations between the west and Moscow so

1:11:52

Russia is seeing this as a huge change in the historical calculus in the region

1:11:58

and mind you it's not just Russia that was affected there were several Chinese journalists who were killed by NATO

1:12:05

bombs after the embassy the Chinese Embassy was struck by sorties May 7th my

1:12:12

birth uh May 7th 1999 so uh which is happens also to be my

1:12:18

date of birth so let's talk about what Russia's

1:12:23

perspective is so on March 24th 1999 Elena milanic a student was at home with

1:12:30

her sister and a friend in Belgrade suddenly the quiet evening was interrupted by an air raid siren the girls quickly hid under the table it

1:12:37

wasn't the safest place but they had gotten lucky their part of the city wasn't attacked over the next 77 days

1:12:43

these girls and other Belgrade residents became better at hiding from the bombs which threatened to kill them every day

1:12:48

the raids were part of NATO's military operation against Yugoslavia a campaign That Shook Up the World Order and not

1:12:54

just in the Balkans so the preconditions were that the Kosovo problem goes many centuries back

1:13:01

located in the southwest of Serbia on the border of Albania the Kosovo region was historically inhabited by two Balan

1:13:07

peoples the serbs and the albanians the serbs consider the region as a major part of the country's history and

1:13:12

culture however albanians have also lived there for Century Centuries by the mid 19th century there were about as

1:13:18

many albanians as serbs in Kosovo ethnic Strife was a common problem in the Balkans retaining their particular

1:13:24

cultural characteris iics serbs albanians croats Gypsies and Muslim

1:13:29

servs live side by side for centuries conflicts between them nonetheless resulted in brutal massacres during

1:13:35

World War II the Balkans were occupied by Germany and Italy and a brutal regime was established in Kosovo serbs were

1:13:41

expelled from the region and many were killed after the war when Tito yoseph bra Tito came to power in Yugoslavia uh
