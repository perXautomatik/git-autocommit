Todo: userscripts 
if you're currently looking at a artist in your library,
make the upper artist/album/tracks buttons reffer to currently viewed entry, not generally all scrobbles.
for example, <https://www.last.fm/user/konstruktor_k/library/music/xotox/Lichtlos>

the button artist goes to <https://www.last.fm/user/konstruktor_k/library/artists> and it would make much more sence if it instead refered to <https://www.last.fm/user/konstruktor_k/library/music/xotox>

same if you're on <https://www.last.fm/user/konstruktor_k/library/music/xotox>
pushing the button albums takes you to <https://www.last.fm/user/konstruktor_k/library/albums> while to me it would make more
sence to be directed to <https://www.last.fm/user/konstruktor_k/library/music/xotox/+albums>

the general buttons could instead be moved up underneth the library button. visible on hover for example.
