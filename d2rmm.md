would it be possible to load files by lines, 
	all the txt files is known to d2rmm as column data
		so in theory we should be able to refere to the lines by there column and row index,
			with something like, 
				in myMod
				each file conforming to staticly loaded mods
					load files
				for each line loaded
					set each property accordingly
