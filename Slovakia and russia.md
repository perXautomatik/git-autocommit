1:06:54

know today is the anniversary of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and I have a

1:06:59

couple of pieces uh that I could or a piece

1:07:05

that I could cover on this issue I think it is very relevant given all that is

1:07:11

going on uh maybe in the chat if you want me to cover this for another 20 30

1:07:16

minutes or so uh maybe put in a one in the chat and I will see how many people

1:07:22

would like me to stay on to do this as well because I want to talk about why

1:07:27

Russia through this uh memory of NATO's

1:07:33

dismemberment of Yugoslavia is so keen on declaring a state of War as it has

1:07:41

there's so many elements to this but we will cover Russia's perspective in particular here for the purposes of

1:07:49

what's been happening uh of late so I got a lot of ones I got a lot of ones

1:07:55

make sure you stick around we still got 2,300 people here uh um so thank you and

1:08:00

I I'll be sure to give shout outs afterward all right we got a lot of people wanting me to stay on to talk

1:08:05

about Yugoslavia so let's do it um talk about Yugoslavia and Russia why Russia

1:08:12

is uh so keen and interested in this War

1:08:18

uh brutal War a historic war and there was an interesting piece recently written in Russian media I think is

1:08:24

worth covering given recent comments so let's get

1:08:37

started on March 24th 1999 nato intervened in a huge way in

1:08:48

Yugoslavia so this bombing campaign lasted 77 days destroyed what was left

1:08:56

of Yugoslavia at the time because the war had been raging for several years before that with NATO's indirect

1:09:02

involvement especially the United States and the destruction of Yugoslavia

1:09:07

is really a story not just in the end of a particular society in the region a

1:09:14

nation in the region that was seen as a problem after the fall of the Soviet

1:09:21

Union seen as a problem by NATO it was one of Nat first campaigns after the

1:09:27

fall of the Soviet Union uh military campaigns and offensive campaign so to

1:09:33

speak and its implications go far beyond just Yugoslavia even though the loss of

1:09:40

Yugoslavia still reverberates across especially the region but the entire

1:09:45

world as a defeat in the attempts of the

1:09:50

global majority to pave their own way out of the dominance and influence of

1:10:00

American hegemony so Russia of course is very interested in this

1:10:07

anniversary of the bombing of Yugoslavia you might ask well why a big reason for this is because

1:10:15

Russia has declared a state of War this is a relatively new assertion it was uh

1:10:21

made on March 22nd just just a day or

1:10:26

less than a day before the horrific crocus attack in Moscow and this state of War has

1:10:34

everything to do with NATO it's everything to do with NATO that's because Russia has declared

1:10:41

it is in a state of War not because it's not trying to wage a special military operation Ukraine and keep the war at a

1:10:48

level keep its military intervention at a level that keeps the door open for

1:10:55

diplomacy Russia has been doing that since the very beginning but it's because NATO is so

1:11:02

directly involved in Ukraine that now we are having NATO member states like

1:11:09

France make direct threats to Russia of

1:11:14

military intervention not unlike what we saw during this period uh when the US

1:11:21

and NATO invaded Yugoslavia so the

1:11:26

history here is very important to Russia so let's look at Russia's perspective on

1:11:34

Yugoslavia they posted this article ruins of Yugoslavia how Russia learned

1:11:40

that NATO poses a threat the US military blocks illegal strikes on Belgrade in

1:11:45

the spring of 1999 forever changed relations between the west and Moscow so

1:11:52

Russia is seeing this as a huge change in the historical calculus in the region

1:11:58

and mind you it's not just Russia that was affected there were several Chinese journalists who were killed by NATO

1:12:05

bombs after the embassy the Chinese Embassy was struck by sorties May 7th my

1:12:12

birth uh May 7th 1999 so uh which is happens also to be my

1:12:18

date of birth so let's talk about what Russia's

1:12:23

perspective is so on March 24th 1999 Elena milanic a student was at home with

1:12:30

her sister and a friend in Belgrade suddenly the quiet evening was interrupted by an air raid siren the girls quickly hid under the table it

1:12:37

wasn't the safest place but they had gotten lucky their part of the city wasn't attacked over the next 77 days

1:12:43

these girls and other Belgrade residents became better at hiding from the bombs which threatened to kill them every day

1:12:48

the raids were part of NATO's military operation against Yugoslavia a campaign That Shook Up the World Order and not

1:12:54

just in the Balkans so the preconditions were that the Kosovo problem goes many centuries back

1:13:01

located in the southwest of Serbia on the border of Albania the Kosovo region was historically inhabited by two Balan

1:13:07

peoples the serbs and the albanians the serbs consider the region as a major part of the country's history and

1:13:12

culture however albanians have also lived there for Century Centuries by the mid 19th century there were about as

1:13:18

many albanians as serbs in Kosovo ethnic Strife was a common problem in the Balkans retaining their particular

1:13:24

cultural characteris iics serbs albanians croats Gypsies and Muslim

1:13:29

servs live side by side for centuries conflicts between them nonetheless resulted in brutal massacres during

1:13:35

World War II the Balkans were occupied by Germany and Italy and a brutal regime was established in Kosovo serbs were

1:13:41

expelled from the region and many were killed after the war when Tito yoseph bra Tito came to power in Yugoslavia uh

1:13:48

and put more wood on the fire he did not allow Serbian refugees to return to the region and wanted to use Kosovo to

1:13:54

pressure Albania he hoped the region would become a bridge between the two countries however the plan fell through and the area

1:13:59

continued to be Albanian by the time Yugoslavia collapsed kosovo's population cons consisted of 75% albanians and 20%

1:14:07

serbs the rest were minorities many Albanian nationalist organizations emerged in the 1980s at

1:14:14

first they committed minor offenses like arson beatings graffiti and so on against the Serbian population however

1:14:20

from the 9s forward Kosovo um undertook attempts to break away from Yugoslavia

1:14:26

and the cost of albanians gravitated towards Albania during Tito's rule of the regions nationalist intelligencia

1:14:32

considerably increas in number and laid the ideological ground for secessionist projects so there was a increased fervor

1:14:39

for Independence and of course we have the KLA which arose from this the Kosovo Liberation Army after the 1991

1:14:47

Independence referendum now mind you The kosov Liberation Army was supported by the west and it launched a full-scale

1:14:54

Guerilla terrorist war against the Serb population by 1998 Belgrade realized it had lost control of the situation and

1:15:00

launched a military operation against the Kaa and Kosovo so the Western media

1:15:06

covered this smallscale yet brutal war in a surprisingly one-sided manner the operation conducted by Serbian forces

1:15:12

was indeed violent but we need to keep in mind that they fought against a terrorist group people in Europe however

1:15:18

in the US were only shown how violent Serbian nationalists uh were to Peaceful Albanian peasants EU and us officials

1:15:25

pressured Belgrade to stop the Bloodshed no one made the same demands in regard to K militants or complain that Albania

1:15:31

was pumping Koso with weapons and training militants the West Was determined to dismantle Yugoslavia so it

1:15:36

supported separatists the private military company MPR which had earlier helped train

1:15:42

Croatian armed forces in their fight against the serbs soon took over the training of the terrorists and mind you

1:15:47

this support of Croatia during this conflict involved a lot of descendants

1:15:54

of Nazis mind you that this was an area that was brutally occupied by the Nazis

1:16:00

by both and fascists so by both Italy and Germany so um there's a long history

1:16:06

here uh that this article necessarily isn't going to get into but uh it's worth noting that uh Serbian nationalism

1:16:13

here is not talking about like fascist kind of nationalism but those who

1:16:18

opposed it like in Croatia you could say uh uh were being empowered by the West uh based on a very

1:16:27

very reactionary ideology so the president yugos of Yugoslavia sladan mosovich saw that he was backed into a

1:16:33

corner but could not just hand over Kosovo meanwhile the war gained momentum acts of violence against civilian serbs

1:16:39

became widespread and the operations of Syrian Security Forces became more violent the serbs tried to deport many

1:16:45

albanians but this was convenient for Albania since K recruiters were waiting for newcomers to draft into the army so

1:16:50

it was getting out of control and of course we never heard of the victims a

1:16:56

Ser during this time I was very young at this time but uh uh you still don't hear

1:17:01

about how Serbia was so terrorized by these operations I mean it was a

1:17:07

fullscale war and the so-called Guerilla Wars are calling an RT I mean it was terrorist activity it was not a

1:17:14

Liberation War by any stretch of the imagination Serbian people suffered the

1:17:20

most uh the K is akin to what you say Al-Qaeda or Isis or these kind of forces

1:17:27

are in West Asia right a paramilitary force a proxy Force armed uh uh and

1:17:36

really um carrying forward a very vicious agenda so one incident that became known as the rakic massacre

1:17:43

clearly demonstrates how confusing the war was and how hard it was to tell who was right and who was wrong in 1999 of

1:17:49

January Serbian policeman was killed near the village of rakak soon afterwards Serbian special police entered the village EU observers and

1:17:55

journalists were warned about the situation in advance an hours long battle began in the course where 45 albanians died K Fighters acknowledge

1:18:02

the loss of eight Fighters but the serbs insisted that most or even all the dead were militants and that they died in combat and were not victims of ethnic

1:18:08

cleansing while expert opinions were divided the Battle of Rak was an example of a tragic drama that unfolds in the

1:18:15

course of Guerilla Warfare and is quite common in counter Insurgency operations in such situations there's no way to

1:18:21

establish truth however in the spring of 1999 Western politicians presented the tragedy and rakic as a massacre that

1:18:27

demanded an immediate response from the International Community so there were then negotiations and Rule Serbian and

1:18:34

Albanian delegations were not able to come to an agreement the serbs were ready for a ceasefire and agreed to

1:18:40

Grant coast of autonomous status but did not want a foreign military contingent on its territory in response NATO

1:18:46

accused the serbs of disrupting negotiations Yugoslavia and mosovich were vilified in the press and NATO

1:18:52

started preparing a military operation the UN Security Council did not sanction the US of military force but most likely

1:18:58

one of the goals of the operation was to demonstrate NATO's Readiness to act without the approval of the International Community mosovich was

1:19:05

told to immediately withdraw Serbian forces from Kosovo and transfer control of the region to NATO's International

1:19:10

contingent this time the demands were backed by military force it was really

1:19:15

not negotiations at all this was a kangaroo process this was all about

1:19:21

using a pretext um uh using misinformation does

1:19:26

it sound familiar like what's going on in Ukraine right now using misinformation to uh uh

1:19:34

justify greater and greater intervention and and that's why that's why this is so

1:19:39

important to understand that Yugoslavia was not just some anomalous case of

1:19:45

ethnic Strife right sometimes it's seen in that vacum no this was really a

1:19:52

manufactured conflict that would not have taken place in the same way even if there were divisions and issues within

1:19:58

Yugoslav Society there were but it wouldn't have taken place in the way that it did without NATO's deep

1:20:04

assistance dare I say without its significant leadership in sparking this

1:20:10

war so NATO bombings in Yugoslavia started on March 24th 1999 the US played

1:20:16

a key role in the operation but a total of 13 countries were involved the alliance did not plan to conduct a

1:20:21

ground operation but made extensive use of its Air Force and cruise missiles to attack the country the forces were

1:20:27

incomparable NATO used a thousand planes and helicopters mainly from military bases in Italy and the aircraft carrier

1:20:34

USS the Roosevelt the K had several thousand Fighters but the combat capability of these units was low

1:20:40

compared to NATO's air fleet yugoslavia's forces were weak the Air Force had only 11 relatively modern

1:20:46

fighter aircraft and several outdated missile systems that had been supplied by the USSR the Soviet Union many years

1:20:52

ago the alliance started the operation by launching several dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles then the attack aircraft

1:20:58

started dropping bombs the first goal is to suppress the Yugoslav missile defense system the strikes were successful

1:21:04

Serbian anti-aircraft Gunners uh tried their best to fight enemy forces for

1:21:10

example air defense officer zultan Dan was able to shoot down an inconspicuous and theoretically invisible f117 stealth

1:21:16

attack aircraft however these minor victories could not change the course of the operation the serbs could only act

1:21:23

from the ground and sporadically attack enemy aircraft using air defense systems Serbian Pilots even tried to attack the

1:21:30

enemy using fighter aircraft this was indeed a cous feat but practically useless from a military point of view in

1:21:35

the entire course of the operation NATO lost only three aircraft and two hops

1:21:41

why do you think the Russian side is focusing on this because what do you think Russia learned here Russia learned

1:21:49

that you had to have an an equal if not

1:21:54

a a measurably uh demonstrative and strong

1:21:59

deterrence Force to ensure that a Yugoslavia does not happen to Russia this is I believe going to be the point

1:22:06

I can't predict what this article is going to say but I believe that's the point why this article is focusing so

1:22:12

much on the military aspect of this after the missile defense systems were suppressed NATO resorted to terrorist

1:22:17

style bombings the attacks on the troops weren't very effective and the Yugoslav units retrained their combat capability

1:22:23

until or or retained their combat capability until the end of the war about 30 combat Vehicles were destroyed

1:22:29

and several hundred Serbian soldiers and officers were killed and wounded considering the fact that over 990,000 servicemen and police officers were

1:22:35

stationed in Kosovo and another 65,000 defended the rest of their country the losses was not very great in other words

1:22:41

NATO strikes disabled the Air Force and air defense systems air defense systems but did not affect the combat capability

1:22:46

of the troops in major way but while they were ineffective in that

1:22:51

way that might not have been the point the point might have been that Civ infrastructure was the Target because it suffered major damage as a result of

1:22:58

NATO bombings and it was a lot harder to conceal a bridge or a TV tower than a tank Bridges industrial facilities and

1:23:04

telecommunication systems um were attacked every day even targets that were not considered strategically

1:23:10

important to Nato were often hit by mistake for example on April 14th 1999 an F-16 fighter jet attacked a convoy of

1:23:18

Civilian Albanian refugees near uh uh near gakov another time a sniper strike

1:23:25

killed 73 people and when an intelligence munition system tried to find military equipment at a Chinese

1:23:30

embassy three people were killed according to the various sources the number of victims varies from 500 to

1:23:36

5700 people many buildings in Belgrade remain ruined to this day and look at

1:23:43

this picture this is uh March 24th 2013 looking at a building that had

1:23:50

still not been rebuilt during NATO's bombing campaign I mean that's just an astounding sight to say the least

1:23:57

because that is nearly 14 years later throughout this time battles between Serbian troops and K Fighters

1:24:04

continued on the ground several dozen volunteers from Russia participated in the fighting and at least three died

1:24:09

despite NATO superiority the serves managed to defeat the Kosovo Liberation Army on the ground the victory was impressive but alas totally useless at

1:24:17

the time so this is what's important because they're going to talk about achievements of this what this all means

1:24:23

okay so they're going to talk about Russia's side of this what what how Russia views this and at the time Russia

1:24:29

was undergoing very difficult economic times and it support for Yugoslavia was reduced to just symbolic gestures after

1:24:35

the start of Air Raids the parliament of Yugoslavia wanted to join the union between Russia and Belarus but Russian

1:24:40

president Boris yelson blocked the initiative there you have Boris yelton once again with another feather in his

1:24:46

very alcohol filled alcohol stench uh

1:24:52

cap uh he blocked uh an possibility of that Union thousands of people protested at the US Embassy in

1:24:58

Moscow every day once an activist even brought a grenade launcher and tried to attack the embassy unfortunately apart

1:25:03

from protesting and loudly condemning the events there was nothing Russia could do in those years Russia's economy

1:25:10

was in shreds and unlike today this just wasn't a story made up by Western politicians and media at that time the

1:25:15

economic crisis was real and the Army had suffered suffered a humiliating defeat in Chia there was nothing Russia

1:25:21

could do to prevent NATO's operation I mean yeah nothing they could do to prevent it on June 1st M mosovich agreed

1:25:27

to all of NATO's demands the alliance's peacekeeping forces entered Kosovo and Serbian troops withdrew from the region

1:25:33

as Yugoslav troops withdrew from Kosovo ethnic cleansing began in the coming months over 1700 people almost all of

1:25:39

them servs or other National minorities were killed by militants w't missing the majority of the REM remaining serbs fled

1:25:46

according to various sources between 200,000 and 350,000 people left the region including

1:25:51

serbs and other minorities Kay militants smashed cultural monuments burn down churches and destroyed anything that

1:25:57

remained of the enemy does that sound like something familiar because

1:26:04

when the coup in Ukraine happened in 2014 afterwards what did we see happen

1:26:09

all over Kiev everything Russia began to be destroyed monuments to the Soviet

1:26:15

Union began to be taken down despite their historic relevance um in their cultural

1:26:21

relevance uh this is kind of power for the course for how NATO does things and

1:26:26

this is why we should not trust anything NATO says about any force that they support because usually uh their

1:26:33

attempts to whitewash uh let's say Ukrainian forces with this air of democracy is

1:26:40

always simply a lie all right and and Serbia teaches us that and N uh

1:26:45

Yugoslavia teaches us that as for NATO troops they did not prevent or stop the pgeon anyway today some servs reign in

1:26:51

Kosovo still most living in a small Enclave the other s Serbian border

1:26:56

negotiations on the status of the region did not yield results for several years in 2008 Kosovo declared independence and

1:27:01

has been recognized as an independent republic by most western states unsurprisingly problems in the region did not end with the expulsion of the

1:27:08

serbs to this day Kosovo is a poor country with major corruption issues the US took an active part in the

1:27:13

Reconstruction of Kosovo but the region was mostly used by businessmen and officials for personal enrichments kind

1:27:18

of similar to what happened to Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union before the Advent of Putin's leadership

1:27:26

okay this is how the US does things it destroys countries dismembers them and then plunders them there is not just

1:27:32

this is not just a political Victory this is not just a political objective

1:27:37

right the military's political objective always includes when it comes to Nato the plunder of these countries at the

1:27:43

behest of their own financial and corporate interests we always have to remember that about war many of them

1:27:50

have profited from murky schemes including former US Secretary of State mine Al ding-dong the Witch Is Dead who

1:27:56

owned a share of the only private mobile network operator in the region and later tried to grab a piece of a state-owned

1:28:01

company coincidentally Albright's daughter is the exclusive director of corporation that distributes grants to

1:28:07

poor countries including Kosovo in Kosovo there are over 800,000 migrant workers per 1.8 million inhabitants wow

1:28:16

moreover the Republic has turned into a strong hold of the Albanian mafia even the Western press was forced to admit the failure of State Building in Kosovo

1:28:23

and that's because they don't give a damn about State Building there's no it that's all a just uh all the same it

1:28:33

means nothing State Building the only point to Nato Wars is

1:28:39

domination dismemberment destabilization for their interest not

1:28:44

the interest of the State State Building that's just that's just for the masses a few years later after the events of 1999

1:28:51

Montenegro peacefully broke away from Yugoslavia and the latter ceased to exist Serbian president mosovich was

1:28:57

overthrown in 2000 as a result of unrest in Belgrade and was secretly extradited to the international criminal tribunal

1:29:03

in the heg 2006 before the trial's conclusion he died at age 64 in the UN prison and immediately suspicions were

1:29:09

ways which have persisted over how he died yeah some people believe he was assassinated and and that was because um

1:29:17

this always happens right Osama Bin Laden mosovich a lot of forces that maybe have inconvenient

1:29:25

information like momar Gaddafi right was sodomized and assassinated a lot of people who have inconvenient truths to

1:29:32

tell the United States doesn't want them going in front of the ha giving their side of the story because while they

1:29:39

mosovich would have been likely uh found guilty of crimes that you know uh uh are

1:29:48

very politicized in nature he would still have the ability through his defense to to uh promote a narrative and

1:29:57

information and facts that are very inconvenient to this NATO War so it's very very reasonable to have suspicions

1:30:05

over why he died so what conclusions did the world draw and how about Russia the

1:30:11

bombing of Yugoslavia was an important apparently highly underestimated turning point in relations between Russia and the West both the Russian Elite and

1:30:17

Society painfully painfully reacted to the tragic events in Yugoslavia this may sound strange but Russia once idealistic

1:30:24

sentiments about the Great Western democracies when the Cold War ended it seemed the US and NATO were unfairly

1:30:30

slandered by Soviet propaganda unfortunately there was a lot of Truth to the Soviet propaganda unfortunately

1:30:36

or fortunately for the Pu whatever your view is I guess for Russia was quite a painful reminder or I should say that's

1:30:43

what I'm saying but for Russia it was quite painful to realize that world politics still resembled an aquarium full of Hungary sharks moreover Russia

1:30:50

traditionally had close and friendly relations with Serbia and the Serbian people but now the serves are publicly attacked and humiliated the elites had

1:30:58

their own reason for concern Russia uh the Russian government regarded Russia us and Russia West relations in an

1:31:03

idealistic way but in 1999 Moscow clearly saw that international law doesn't provide any guarantees on the

1:31:09

global Arena Yugoslavia was destroyed without any serious grounds simply because Western politicians had decided

1:31:15

so the country lost part of its territory and The cutof Enclave was subjected to ethnic cleansing while the

1:31:21

world turned a blind eye all this was done under the gu of a rules-based international order territorial

1:31:26

integrity was considered one of the invaluable principles of international law but it too was trampled moreover in

1:31:32

the general context of the Bulan Wars and conflicts all the blame was put on Yugoslavia and Serbia regardless of

1:31:37

whether serbs were Rebels who fought against the government or vice versa none of this resembled Justice or law it

1:31:43

became clear that neither agreements nor international law could protect any country including Russia from external military

1:31:49

force and that countries could only rely on the political situation in their own ability to cope with threats ding ding

1:31:57

ding ding ding that's a huge lesson it became clear let's read that again that

1:32:03

neither agreements or international law could protect any country including Russia from external military force and

1:32:09

that countries could only rely on the political situation and their own ability to handle threats so what does

1:32:16

that tell you tells you that Russia learned through Yugoslavia that if it

1:32:22

was going to make itself a puppet it was going to slovenly follow the collective

1:32:28

West down whatever path it wanted for Russia this would mean it was not it

1:32:33

would not be safe from the very fate that Yugoslavia had um undergone and

1:32:40

mind you at around this time there was the wolfowitz doctrine which had been

1:32:47

going around right during the Clinton Administration so Paul wolfowitz right

1:32:52

he is this long time he wrote this after the Cold War his Doctrine in 1992 which

1:33:01

was released um by the defense department had as its

1:33:08

uh uh uh you know as head of the um uh uh as part of the under secretary

1:33:15

for policy in the Pentagon Wolowitz had as an agenda and the people backing him

1:33:21

the balkanization of Russia they was explicit mention of not allowing Russia

1:33:27

to rise up again it would didn't say Russia in particular but it said in the

1:33:32

posts Soviet kind of postc cold war calculus that there will be no rise of

1:33:38

any kind of similar force and that was a direct targeting of Russia to keep it

1:33:44

weak and so Russia not only had that to think about in chew on but also then

1:33:50

just seven years later saw that Doctrine being enforced in Yugoslavia so this realization was doubly important since

1:33:56

Russia had Sim similar problem with insurgence in Chia the Kremlin could not help but think that if the West could

1:34:02

use this pretext to attack Yugoslavia it could use the same strategy against Russia on the other hand Moscow came to

1:34:08

reasonable conclusion that if the arbitrator twists the rules as he likes he loses Authority their sarcastic

1:34:13

expression you don't understand this case is different which implies the hypocrisy of those who condemn others for certain actions while engaging in

1:34:19

condemned Behavior remains popular on Russian internet to this day for the Russian political Elite Kosovo became a

1:34:25

classic example of a different Case Western journalists and politicians often emphasize that the situation in Kosovo was unique however the ill- fated

1:34:33

region was obviously no different from dozens of other hotspots why was Kosovo a special case why weren't transnistria

1:34:39

South oia otia uh uh abazia negoro kabak Serbian

1:34:47

kinia or Catalonia just as exceptional what other situations will be considered special and what other conflicts between

1:34:54

authorities and separatists will be sufficient grounds for NATO to carry out bombings and allow ethnic cleansing the

1:34:59

bombing of Belgrade destroyed the image of the rules-based international order of course it wasn't the last time that

1:35:04

this rule of law and the demands of Justice were ignored by Western countries after the collapse of the Soviet Union as the Iraq War followed

1:35:12

only four years later however the events in Yugoslavia had clearly demonstrated that a country that wants to protect its

1:35:17

sovereignty from external threats can only rely on its own strength and that

1:35:22

of its allly I or proven allies so that was WR written by a Russian

1:35:28

historian Roman schuma for Russ RT formerly Russia Today and the reason why

1:35:33

I shared that is because well it didn't give the most comprehensive historical analysis mind you it did give a

1:35:40

good take I believe on why Russia is concerned about NATO because as I said

1:35:48

before they have declared a state of War right Russia has said they are in a

1:35:54

state of war and that's because NATO is involved in Ukraine but it's not just about Ukraine I want to pull up one last

1:35:59

thing to kind of make this point or bring this point home okay NATO

1:36:06

expansion here stop the war UK so stop the war UK is this uh graphic I want to

1:36:12

show you on NATO expansion because oftentimes you hear well NATO expansion

1:36:19

is no threat if you couple the intervention in Yugoslavia war in Yugoslavia with NATO expansion you can

1:36:27

see and then not to mention what happens in Ukraine over a decade and a half

1:36:33

later then you get to see how putting all these things together it is

1:36:39

indeed not just reasonable but correct to assert that NATO expansion is a

1:36:45

threat to Russia and Russia then has learned from Yugoslavia and the NATO War

1:36:52

there that if it is not strong enough it is if it is not militarily prepared if

1:36:58

it is not taking care of sovereignty and ensuring that it is uh uh you know that

1:37:07

it is a reliable partner on the world stage to the global majority that all these factors would then lead to a

1:37:13

Yugoslav possible situation right a balkanization effort by NATO so here is

1:37:20

the graphic okay so I'm actually just let's just let it play once so here you see over the years uh and it keeps going

1:37:29

so there you have so 1949 to 1952 you see that on the periphery of Western

1:37:35

Europe in the Mediterranean you have turkey and Portugal and countries like that joining after the end of World War

1:37:40

II then 1955 you have of course West Germany there 1982 you have Spain

1:37:46

joining then of course you have the fall of the wall in 1990 and of course Germany becomes so-called United

1:37:54

uh then you have Poland Czech Republic Hungary joined in 1999 then in 2004 look at that you have

1:38:01

Romania Bulgaria Lithuania lvia Estonia all these countries on the border mind

1:38:06

you these all these countries rest right on Russia's border this is Russia and this is Estonia laia and Lithuania of

1:38:13

course is not too far off so then you have 2009 of course uh you have smaller countries down here based on the split

1:38:20

up of Yugoslavia Albania negro so uh that stops there but of course we've had

1:38:27

Sweden and Finland also uh ascended into um or given a session into NATO so and

1:38:35

those countries are indeed uh especially uh uh I think Finland shares a border

1:38:41

with Russia so and Sweden is right right around the corner so so we're talking about major expansion on the part of

1:38:49

NATO the Yugoslav War being a huge

1:38:55

um historical event this destructive war

1:39:01

that killed I mean the civilian toll there's debates about it but we can bet

1:39:07

the thousands died in a 77-day bombing campaign by NATO and that you had TV

1:39:14

stations Bridges civilian infrastructure Hospital schools destroyed people were

1:39:19

put in a state of suffering a mass suffering and of course a country that

1:39:26

once had a high standard of living people in Yugoslavia had a high standard of living life expectancy was high for

1:39:33

the region and for many years there had been of course there were issues but for many

1:39:40

years there were there was Unity okay and it wasn't until late 80s and 90s

1:39:47

when there were geopolitical issues where there was more opening up on the

1:39:53

part of Yugoslavia when there was more economic dislocation this was the post 1970s

1:40:00

world order was much more difficult economically in many ways than you know

1:40:08

the period uh after World War II um for many

1:40:13

countries to not just maintain a standard of living but to hold off the

1:40:18

pressure from a an increasingly militaristic and exploitative Collective

1:40:26

West led by the United States because the United States had lots of plans not just for the Soviet Union's end not just

1:40:33

the end of the so-called Cold War to defeat the Soviet Union but to really then turn toward Yugoslavia a big reason

1:40:40

why Yugoslavia began to be a problem for the United States and the United States in NATO's eyes is because the Soviet

1:40:46

Union was no longer there and there was no need to have Yugoslavia be some kind of buffer some kind of neutral buffer

1:40:52

between the Soviet Union and the United States so all that is to say is that it

1:40:58

was a brutal war and Russia has learned from this the biggest lesson lesson that Russia came out from this with and this

1:41:05

is so interesting because this basically ended in 1999 200000 and what happened

1:41:10

just after that Vladimir Putin became the leader of Russia and for the next 20

1:41:16

plus years now we're in what year 23 24 Vladimir Putin has changed the calculus

1:41:23

in Russia in terms of how Russia is ruled it is no longer a country that

1:41:28

sells itself its sovereignty its resources and everything away to the collective West so that Russia can be

1:41:35

super exploited while the collective West gets all of or reaps all the benefits or should we say the Elites in

1:41:42

the collective West reap all the benefits that's no longer happening that's why NATO wants to see Russia

1:41:49

dismembered Allah Yugoslavia that's why you had Victoria Newland how many times was she saying that Russia was in for

1:41:55

surprises on the battlefield in Ukraine despite the fact that Ukraine has been reeling and uh suffering on the

1:42:02

battlefield for quite many months now but nonetheless Victoria nulan admitted

1:42:07

herself that this isn't the Russia that the United States had wanted they

1:42:14

wanted Russia to combust to internally combust fall apart and collapse and

1:42:22

become a state that Yugoslavia became one that is dismembered

1:42:29

dislocated that is ruled by puppets by people who do not have the best

1:42:34

interests of the Russian people and of course all of its diversity and all the

1:42:40

diversity of Russia various ethnic groups Etc uh they want all of those people to essentially live in chaos to

1:42:48

live in very small little stat lits that can be easily controlled politically and

1:42:55

that would achieve in the minds of people like Victoria Newland the Paul Wolowitz Doctrine so this has been an

1:43:02

agenda for quite some time and this is what Russia had to learn over the last 20 plus years under the leadership of

1:43:09

Vladimir Putin that it is incredibly important to not just maintain sovereignty and defend sovereignty but

1:43:15

to chart A New World Order away from the so-called rules-based International order to repair the relationship between

1:43:22

Russ Russia and China to ensure that these two countries Remain the anchor

1:43:28

for the rest of the global majority to move away from the uh uh you know death

1:43:35

uh inducing tentacles of the US Empire and all of its hegemony this has been the

1:43:42

mission of Russia since Vladimir Putin has come into power and this will

1:43:47

continue to be as he enjoys the uh immense legitimacy of the last

1:43:53

presidential election and as the uh Imperial hegemone as the United States

1:43:58

and Ukraine and all this get desperate so much so that they're resorting to the most heinous of attacks so as we saw in

1:44:05

crocus so Russia is interested in developing the Russian people its interested in defending their interests

1:44:11

and it's an interested in being a stable and positive multi-polar force on the

1:44:16

world stage even if that means having to get hands dirty unfortunately that's what Ukraine has been all about needing

1:44:23

to put um a military force behind these

1:44:28

principles when defending them by other means became exhausted and became

1:44:34

utterly ineffective uh Russia is in a state of war and it's going to continue to learn

1:44:40

from the Yugoslavia case in order to preserve itself and to forward its

1:44:48

objectives and and we need to know this because we don't get the Russian side we don't get that from the mainstream media

1:44:56

and certainly we know that the only reason Russia has declared a states of war is because NATO is preparing
