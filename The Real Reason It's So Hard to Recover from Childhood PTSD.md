I'll never forget the day I found out
 0:03 _there was a name for what was wrong with
 0:05 _me for the weird behaviors and emotions
 0:08 _that I couldn't seem to stop and for the
 0:10 _mistakes that I kept making over and
 0:12 _over again the name of it is complex
 0:16 _PTSD which is the kind that comes from
 0:18 _chronic exposure to intense stress
 0:21 _usually in childhood it can happen in
 0:23 _adulthood but the thing I'm focusing on
 0:26 _are the wounds of trauma that happened
 0:27 _when you were a kid and
 0:30 _especially my life changed when I
 0:33 _learned the word for the core symptom of
 0:35 _this kind of
 0:37 _PTSD neurological
 0:39 _disregulation now I had lived most of my
 0:42 _life disregulated and thinking it was
 0:44 _just me I would get discombobulated or
 0:47 _numb or too intense and I'd get clumsy
 0:51 _I'd trip over myself and drop things so
 0:54 _I learned about cptsd and disregulation
 0:57 _and I learned how to get re-regulated
 1:00 _and I felt so different I thought
 1:02 _nothing bad was ever going to get into
 1:04 _my life again but the thing is like all
 1:08 _people and especially like all people
 1:09 _who have lived through trauma in
 1:10 _childhood I had self-defeating behaviors
 1:14 _now I knew this and I knew it for a long
 1:16 _time and I thought it was just cuz I was
 1:18 _a bad person I was ashamed about it and
 1:20 _then I learned that it was actually very
 1:22 _normal for people who had trauma still
 1:25 _though I didn't know what to do about it
 1:28 _so what I learned was when you learn to
 1:30 _reregulate your nervous system it can
 1:33 _get better and if you've watched even
 1:35 _one of my videos before you know I'm
 1:37 _always talking about the importance of
 1:38 _re-regulation and I teach how to do that
 1:41 _you can find my my course on that or my
 1:44 _book re-regulated Down Below in the
 1:46 _description section but the problem was
 1:48 _even though I was re-regulating I kept
 1:50 _doing things that would knock me back
 1:52 _from a re-regulated state back into
 1:55 _disregulation and I'm talking about
 1:57 _self-defeating behaviors which I'm going
 1:59 _to list here for you so that you can see
 2:01 _if you have any of them when when I was
 2:04 _disregulated my self-defeating behaviors
 2:06 _would just get activated that's what
 2:08 _happens if you don't get disregulated
 2:10 _they don't tend to activate they might
 2:12 _everybody has some of them but
 2:14 _disregulation makes it so much harder to
 2:16 _control they just leak out they get
 2:17 _bigger than they should be so I had to
 2:20 _learn to re-regulate and I had to learn
 2:23 _to face honestly how I was sabotaging
 2:25 _myself because as bad as my childhood
 2:28 _trauma was I was keeping the effects of
 2:31 _my trauma alive with my self-defeating
 2:35 _behaviors I was
 3:00 _things get better now some of these
 3:02 _aren't such a big deal and some of them
 3:05 _are huge and they can ruin your life
 3:07 _it's a matter of degrees they always
 3:10 _start as an innocent way of getting out
 3:12 _of pain all self-defeating Behavior
 3:14 _you're just trying to get out of pain
 3:16 _but if you keep using the behavior to
 3:18 _try to get out of pain pretty soon the
 3:20 _pain gets bigger and if you don't find a
 3:22 _way to change that self-defeating
 3:23 _Behavior it will create more pain and
 3:26 _more life problems and keep you ret
 3:28 _traumatized in way that totally blocks
 3:31 _your healing so this is the hardest
 3:33 _thing to face to acknowledge that today
 3:36 _a lot of what's hurting you and holding
 3:38 _you back is not your parents not anymore
 3:41 _not because of uh anything that happened
 3:44 _to you not anymore today what's
 3:47 _happening is your own behavior and the
 3:49 _worse you were hurt back then the more
 3:52 _likely it is that you have a pattern of
 3:54 _hurting yourself now and it's not your
 3:57 _fault what happened to you or that you
 3:59 _ended up affecting Ed by that but now
 4:01 _every bit of your courage is going to be
 4:03 _needed because there are things that
 4:05 _only you can change self-defeating
 4:08 _behaviors are those things these are
 4:11 _things like the people you allow into
 4:12 _your life the way you take care of
 4:15 _yourself the choices that you make about
 4:17 _partners and jobs and money and where
 4:20 _you live and the people you admire and
 4:22 _the things you say and of course the way
 4:25 _you act it's easy peasy to spot this in
 4:29 _other people
 4:30 _but it can be really hard to see it in
 4:32 _ourselves we go into denial we defend
 4:35 _ourselves that what we're doing is
 4:37 _necessary I'm self-medicating I have to
 4:40 _but it doesn't actually make things
 4:42 _better that's the nature of a
 4:43 _self-defeating Behavior it defeats you
 4:46 _changing is what makes things better and
 4:48 _I teach this because for me this was the
 4:51 _hardest part of healing and I mean yes
 4:55 _the stuff that happened to me when I was
 4:56 _a kid was harmful it was not okay but in
 5:01 _the end it was the stuff that I was
 5:04 _doing to myself the bad relationships
 5:06 _chain smoking the lashing out at people
 5:10 _you know that's that's what was taking
 5:12 _my life down and keeping me from healing
 5:13 _as an adult and if you've taken my
 5:15 _courses you've probably heard my story
 5:18 _well I wasn't getting better for a long
 5:20 _time because of all the hurtful
 5:22 _situations that I kept putting myself
 5:24 _into I didn't know any better but I was
 5:27 _dragging other people into them and it
 5:29 _was just problem after
 5:30 _problem and then I changed and it's not
 5:34 _like I'm a perfect person never have
 5:36 _been never will be I'm a work in
 5:38 _progress just like you but if you're
 5:40 _stuck in a pattern I get it I do
 5:44 _understand stuck and patterns and I'm
 5:46 _here to show you a better way okay so if
 5:50 _you want to hear some of these
 5:51 _self-defeating behaviors and ask
 5:53 _yourself if there are any priorities
 5:55 _that you don't want to do anymore let's
 5:57 _go through them now remember you're not
 5:59 _going to have have all of these but you
 6:00 _might have some and some will be worse
 6:03 _than others so you can ask yourself if
 6:05 _you relate to any of these number one
 6:08 _black and white thinking so traumatized
 6:11 _people are often drawn to extreme views
 6:14 _and you know strong authority figures
 6:16 _and groups who follow gurus you might
 6:19 _notice that you're often outraged about
 6:21 _current events and God knows the news is
 6:25 _there to add fuel to the fire they want
 6:27 _outrage so when we engage in that we're
 6:30 _sort of inviting it in but that outrage
 6:32 _is activating disregulation and perhaps
 6:35 _self-defeating Behavior as a traumatized
 6:38 _person just remember you may be extra
 6:40 _vulnerable to outrage and you know it
 6:43 _does feel good sometimes when you're
 6:44 _depressed to get mad but it's not it's
 6:47 _it's the lowest grade anti-depressant
 6:49 _there is so if you get to the point that
 6:52 _you find that you're losing your freedom
 6:53 _to disagree with people and stay friends
 6:56 _or you're losing your freedom to leave a
 6:58 _particularly dominant person or maybe
 7:00 _that you are the dominant person or
 7:03 _you're you're talking smack about other
 7:05 _people and trying to get other people to
 7:06 _agree with you or you're trying to hurt
 7:08 _their reputation or you're cutting off
 7:10 _contact with people who are outside of
 7:13 _your opinion bubble you may be veering
 7:15 _off into black and white thinking to the
 7:17 _degree that it's a self-defeating
 7:19 _behavior all right number two neglect of
 7:24 _your body you might find that for
 7:26 _reasons bigger than the limits of your
 7:28 _income you're wearing shabby clothes or
 7:31 _you have poor hygiene or you don't
 7:34 _exercise people who struggled in
 7:36 _childhood are prone to do this and
 7:40 _sometimes we neglect medical and dental
 7:41 _care even when we can afford it at the
 7:45 _extreme though neglecting our body and
 7:47 _our health can become self harm and so
 7:50 _at that point it becomes a very clear
 7:51 _self-defeating behavior number three is
 7:55 _the addictive use of food yes food this
 7:59 _includes everything from carrying a
 8:02 _whole lot of extra weight to having an
 8:05 _eating disorder not eating to a tendency
 8:08 _to indulge in large amounts of fast Caro
 8:12 _carbohydrates like sugar and flour and
 8:14 _things that kind of put you in a food
 8:16 _coma now that kind of feeling can be
 8:18 _calming at first I know that is in the
 8:21 _past has been one of my kind of drugs of
 8:24 _choice is just to numb out on a bunch of
 8:26 _carbs it helps it feels like it helps
 8:29 _any way when you're disregulated and you
 8:31 _just want to calm down but in the long
 8:33 _run it just makes you more disregulated
 8:35 _it throws you off of a sort of steady
 8:37 _energy level and ability to focus and
 8:39 _pay attention that is what makes life
 8:41 _good and happy number four is the
 8:44 _addictive use of media and entertainment
 8:48 _so do you watch TV or browse the
 8:50 _internet or scroll your phone or play
 8:52 _games enough that it's interfering with
 8:54 _your sleep or your meals or your daily
 8:57 _routine or do these forms of Recreation
 8:59 _cause problems for your
 9:01 _family um maybe you don't meet your
 9:04 _responsibilities at work or fulfill your
 9:07 _education or pay your bills because
 9:10 _you're so sucked into your screens
 9:12 _that's a self-defeating behavior number
 9:15 _five is dishonesty and this includes
 9:18 _things like
 9:19 _exaggerating hiding important personal
 9:22 _truths or
 9:23 _preferences lying stealing cheating on a
 9:28 _significant other
 9:30 _tax evasion or any kind of illegal
 9:32 _activity the minute you're lying you are
 9:35 _losing your Source you're losing your
 9:37 _connection to all that's good and I
 9:39 _recommend cutting it out
 9:41 _immediately number six is work problems
 9:45 _and this includes staying stuck in
 9:47 _unfulfilling
 9:48 _work like um work that is not meaningful
 9:52 _to you but maybe you're afraid to leave
 9:54 _because the transition just feels
 9:55 _overwhelming to you it's self-defeating
 9:57 _Behavior to stay like that
 10:00 _although everybody gets there sometimes
 10:02 _another one is under earning where
 10:04 _you're you're not earning a fair and
 10:06 _adequate wage to support yourself and
 10:09 _your dependents and it's very very
 10:12 _common for for traumatized people to get
 10:14 _stuck in underere earning um there's a
 10:16 _fear of conflict for asking for enough
 10:18 _money and a fear of the pressure of
 10:21 _doing a job that's a little more
 10:22 _challenging that might pay you know a
 10:24 _higher wage and that's real until you
 10:27 _have the the skills to re-regulate
 10:30 _enough that you can start to stretch the
 10:32 _boundaries of your life and let it be
 10:34 _bigger and take on tasks and jobs and
 10:36 _relationships that do require the
 10:38 _ability to self-regulate but you can do
 10:41 _that this can also include uh avoiding
 10:44 _employment just you know just staying
 10:46 _out of it not bothering with it falling
 10:48 _into ruin over it having more than your
 10:50 _share of conflicts with employers and
 10:54 _co-workers you know there's usually
 10:56 _somebody like that in every workplace
 10:58 _but it's stuff like suing or getting
 11:00 _sued making accusations like having that
 11:02 _be the whole Mo of somebody is a
 11:05 _self-defeating Behavior nobody wants to
 11:07 _have a person like that around for long
 11:09 _or acting in a way that makes co-workers
 11:12 _feel intimidated or threatened or
 11:16 _undermined number seven and I've
 11:18 _recently added this to the list because
 11:20 _I talk about self-defeating behaviors a
 11:22 _lot but this is such a big one
 11:24 _procrastination and this is really
 11:25 _common with cptsd it's often a result of
 11:29 _your nervous system being in freeze mode
 11:32 _and it's a you know this is a trauma
 11:33 _reaction that we don't totally have
 11:35 _control over initially but you can work
 11:38 _on it and in some other videos you can
 11:40 _learn about how to get out of freeze the
 11:42 _number one thing to do is to move your
 11:44 _body just that's your immediate fix for
 11:47 _feeling like you can't get out of
 11:48 _procrastination is just move your body
 11:50 _get outside and move around and then you
 11:52 _know there are dozens of solutions out
 11:54 _there for what you can do you know for
 11:55 _time management and getting things done
 11:58 _but really when you realize that your
 11:59 _nervous system is just like ah your your
 12:01 _your nervous system is playing posum
 12:04 _which is an old old reaction from your
 12:06 _brain to being under stress so this can
 12:09 _result though it has terrible
 12:11 _consequences whatever the causes are you
 12:14 _Miss deadlines you don't pay bills you
 12:16 _don't follow through on tasks at home
 12:18 _and at work where other people are
 12:19 _counting on you and overall you feel
 12:22 _exhausted and unmotivated when mentally
 12:25 _you want to be moving forward in your
 12:28 _life number eight and I also just added
 12:31 _it to my list of self-defeating
 12:32 _behaviors if you can believe it I talk
 12:34 _about self-defeating behaviors a lot and
 12:36 _I talk about clutter a lot but clutter
 12:38 _belongs here now clutter also is a
 12:40 _symptom of trauma a sign of trauma but
 12:43 _it's also a
 12:46 _retraumatization of stuff in your living
 12:48 _space or yard to the point that it
 12:50 _becomes unhygienic it's gross it's
 12:53 _uncleanable it's such a mess that you
 12:55 _don't even know where to begin or it
 12:57 _prevents you from using rooms in your
 12:59 _home or having company over either
 13:01 _because you don't have space for them to
 13:03 _sit or you just feel too ashamed to show
 13:05 _them what's going on so the tendency to
 13:08 _clutter Can it can also be mental or
 13:11 _emotional where problems you haven't
 13:13 _dealt with are piled up and it
 13:15 _discourages you from facing the problem
 13:17 _or talking to the people involved or
 13:19 _getting involved in anything new you
 13:21 _feel so burdened by the mental energy
 13:23 _that's just getting drained from you all
 13:26 _the time by unsolved problems with
 13:28 _people and problems so clutter can also
 13:31 _take the form of an over full schedule
 13:34 _where you fill your empty time with
 13:36 _activities out of fear of loneliness or
 13:39 _a sense of anxiety when you have time to
 13:41 _relax or be alone so you just are always
 13:45 _going going going going until you're
 13:47 _stressing yourself out it defeats you
 13:50 _number nine is blame and this includes
 13:53 _having a hard time seeing your own role
 13:55 _in problems it's victim thinking it's
 13:58 _bitterness
 13:59 _it's casually saying things about other
 14:01 _people that hurt their reputation
 14:03 _terrible thing to do there's a word for
 14:05 _that calumny it's a very bad thing to do
 14:08 _to try to get other people to see and
 14:11 _agree with some terrible thing you've
 14:12 _said about people especially when you're
 14:14 _not certain it's true so blame can also
 14:18 _be believing that all of your problems
 14:20 _are because of this one thing it could
 14:22 _be racism or sexism or foreigners or one
 14:25 _or another political party or certain
 14:27 _foods or certain approach to education
 14:29 _or some medical thing and you know these
 14:32 _things all can be problems big problems
 14:35 _but they're not the only problem and if
 14:37 _it's clouding your ability to see that
 14:39 _there is something in this tangle of
 14:41 _problems that you do have control over
 14:44 _then it's a self-defeating Behavior
 14:46 _Number 10 is numbing with substances
 14:49 _like alcohol and drugs and I don't
 14:50 _really need to Define this or explain
 14:52 _why it can undermine your healing except
 14:55 _to say that if it's happening it is a
 14:56 _very high priority to heal because
 14:58 _basically everything else is going to
 15:00 _sit there and be a problem and perhaps
 15:02 _become a worse problem over time as long
 15:04 _as you don't address the substance
 15:07 _abuse number 11 is irritability and we
 15:11 _get angry sometimes for no reason we get
 15:14 _into arguments and ranting in the car
 15:17 _online face to face and in the extreme
 15:20 _this can include rage attacks and even
 15:22 _violence that is a absolute must stop
 15:26 _the irritability and rage will do more
 15:29 _harm to your life and your relationships
 15:31 _faster than just about anything else
 15:33 _number 12 is the attraction to troubled
 15:37 _partners and friends now people who were
 15:40 _abused or neglected as children are
 15:42 _often attracted to people who were
 15:44 _themselves traumatized including those
 15:46 _who have high levels of drama ongoing
 15:49 _major problems conflicts serious legal
 15:53 _and financial problems and they import
 15:56 _problems into your life so when that's
 15:58 _who you feel at home with it's almost
 16:00 _certain that your life is going to be
 16:01 _full of
 16:02 _problems number 13 is unfulfilling
 16:06 _romantic relationships now you may avoid
 16:09 _dating relationships altogether thinking
 16:12 _you're just taking a little break and
 16:13 _one day you'll get back to it but then
 16:14 _you look and it's been seven years that
 16:17 _could be a self-defeating
 16:18 _behavior um you might stay in bad
 16:21 _relationships where there's no intimacy
 16:23 _or there's even emotional or physical
 16:26 _abuse and you might be doing this to
 16:29 _avoid the pain that you would go through
 16:30 _from ending the relationship it it it's
 16:32 _so common for traumatized people because
 16:35 _that abandonment wound makes the cost of
 16:37 _leaving even terrible relationships very
 16:39 _high or feel that way but with support
 16:42 _you can do
 16:43 _it number 14 is the abuse of your
 16:47 _sexuality and this can include an overly
 16:50 _sexualized appearance or inappropriately
 16:53 _seductive behavior in situations where
 16:56 _that is not a good thing for other
 16:58 _people or for you and as a result of
 17:01 _your upbringing you may have a distorted
 17:04 _sense of the messages that you're
 17:05 _sending or poorly developed boundaries
 17:08 _hard to recognize you know what's what's
 17:11 _comfortable and okay with somebody in
 17:13 _your presence and when you might be
 17:15 _Crossing those boundaries and making
 17:17 _them uncomfortable or even feel
 17:19 _threatened number 15 is fantasy now this
 17:23 _also can be a self-defeating Behavior
 17:26 _people say oh fantasy it's harmless it's
 17:28 _wonderful not not always it can go too
 17:30 _far and this includes things like
 17:32 _romantic Obsession or
 17:34 _limerance um for example obsessing on
 17:37 _what it would be like to be with someone
 17:39 _who you're not with and who has told you
 17:41 _to please leave them alone or
 17:43 _fantasizing about a successful future
 17:45 _that you're not pursuing in any
 17:47 _realistic way but it dominates your
 17:49 _thoughts and your identity you've
 17:52 _basically checked out of the real world
 17:54 _which is where the pursuit of good
 17:55 _things can ever actually happen so to
 17:57 _the degree that you do this you're not
 18:00 _going to be present you're not going to
 18:01 _be in touch with reality you're not
 18:03 _going to be able to take reasonable
 18:05 _actions to go for what you want and in
 18:08 _the extreme it can go so far as stalking
 18:10 _or delusional thinking number 16 is
 18:13 _avoidance and this can take the form of
 18:15 _avoiding people avoiding
 18:17 _responsibilities and avoiding
 18:19 _participation in groups where you kind
 18:22 _of belong and it can also take the form
 18:25 _of social sexual and emotional anorexia
 18:28 _you may have never heard of that but
 18:30 _that's the word for when people are
 18:32 _depriving themselves of needed contact
 18:34 _with other people and distorted thinking
 18:37 _is going on that makes it seem like this
 18:38 _is virtuous or healing or helpful now I
 18:41 _know that sometimes taking a break from
 18:44 _people or from dating is how we bring
 18:45 _ourselves back together but it can go
 18:48 _too far and that's when it becomes a
 18:49 _self-defeating
 18:50 _behavior number 17 is debting and by
 18:54 _that I mean getting into debt and while
 18:57 _financial hardship can happen to anybody
 19:00 _and financial stability is never
 19:02 _guaranteed debt can become a
 19:05 _self-defeating behavior when you're
 19:06 _living beyond your means to pay for a
 19:08 _place to live and transportation and
 19:11 _clothes and Recreation and again I know
 19:13 _that there are situations in life where
 19:15 _you still need those things and you do
 19:17 _not have the means but when I say debing
 19:19 _I'm talking about you do have the means
 19:22 _but an extravagant limit is sort of
 19:24 _taking over your concept of what it's
 19:26 _okay to spend and you're getting
 19:28 _yourself in trouble and defeating your
 19:30 _freedom trauma can interfere with your
 19:33 _ability to consistently earn a living
 19:35 _and it and your ability to evaluate
 19:38 _consequences for overspending also if
 19:40 _you're like me and you grew up poor you
 19:42 _know you get a kind of weird sense of
 19:44 _like maybe if I had this furniture or
 19:46 _this place to live it would solve this
 19:49 _anxiety I feel or I would feel more like
 19:51 _I fit in but there's a balance there in
 19:54 _some of the worst forms debting can turn
 19:57 _into a gambling addiction or
 19:59 _unsustainable get-rich quick mentality
 20:01 _stuff and it can also lead to
 20:03 _foreclosure and bankruptcy and
 20:05 _ultimately
 20:07 _homelessness number 18 is a habit of
 20:10 _repeating traumatic patterns now this
 20:13 _happens because of neur the neurological
 20:15 _injury how many times have you made a
 20:19 _terrible mistake and swore to yourself
 20:21 _you'll never do it again and then before
 20:23 _you know you've done it again you're
 20:25 _doing it again okay that is so common
 20:28 _for people with trauma and it has to do
 20:30 _with brain functioning and how we react
 20:32 _to stress and decision-making and the
 20:34 _prediction of risk so it's there it's
 20:36 _kind of part of the atmosphere for us
 20:39 _but we can change it so we struggle at
 20:42 _times to see red flags and to step back
 20:44 _from where trouble appears to recognize
 20:47 _somebody as a sick and dangerous person
 20:50 _this blind spot though can leave you
 20:52 _vulnerable to ever worsening harm that
 20:55 _is how it happens and it can give you
 20:57 _worse symptoms that are difficult to
 20:59 _heal so this list it may sound
 21:02 _overwhelming it may sound like it's just
 21:04 _blaming you or dumping so much
 21:06 _responsibility on you and again it is
 21:08 _not your fault you have trauma but what
 21:11 _you do now to change these
 21:13 _self-defeating behaviors can make a
 21:15 _tremendous difference you don't have to
 21:17 _change everything at once if you can
 21:19 _identify one self-defeating behavior and
 21:22 _begin working to adjust it it can it can
 21:25 _make all the difference in your life and
 21:27 _it can make it easier to make the next
 21:29 _change and then the next one healing is
 21:33 _possible you only need to start and if
 21:36 _you want a list of the self-defeating
 21:37 _behaviors that I just mentioned in this
