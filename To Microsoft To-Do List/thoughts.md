should i leave a ref to the reppo with the different copyies of one file repos.
        maybe easier to use a svn repo for this, as i don't know if you could just dropp a repo reff without incorperating into a exsisting repo also residing there.

        svn could be both local central or remote central, but right now it's easier to point to the local central
        but i wonder if 
        
        git couldn't have a central object storage folder
            for exampel on mechanical harddrive.


folder image orkistartion with docker, basicly, docker but without underlaying os.
    but would it be able to the when done, export it's inner structure, or make hardlinks to it's inner structure?
    basicly a read only snapshot of a folder, distrobuted like docker.
    
* a folder or a file system should be a version control system, and one aproach would be to trace what is duplicates and what's not.
