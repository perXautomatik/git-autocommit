# The scheduling app of dreams

Don't assume the day starts by a certain time, instead set up order of event, connect with external calendar for non flexible events, and wait for active check-in, the check-ins could be a geographical change, nft tag or barcode, or certain programs, face identification, through activity-watch and similar.
Confirm that a event is done, and if not, assume sequence flow is in idle untill event is done, 
Specify what type of an event is, and specify how reminding should be done and when, for example as a voice anoucning it, or a voice asking for what state you are in, 
distinguishing between goals and actual tangiable tasks, 
Add tasks in batch, allow specifications and relations in as a cascading event, assuming softly that a setting is set for an object if, provided in similar objects, the only setting that's truly hard is to specify the property intrinsically.
