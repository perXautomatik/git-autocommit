But why, though?
 
wrong this is not what we do this should not be done it is a bad way to use the
 
computer don't do it but then why would you anyway what would motivate someone
 
to do this to put this much effort and risk into a feature this dumb cuz let's be real here this is useless what's it
 
getting you an extra 10 seconds to look at your calendar you can barely read it in time I mean you would have to pause
 
the boot process and at that point just let it finish and use Outlook and okay
 
if Outlook was taking 20 seconds to load then they could have just bundled a 256 kilobyte application that reads those
 
exact same jpegs that just displays them on Startup this confers no imaginable benefits whatsoever why did they make
 
it well I have two theories here's number
 
one an engineer got excited by UEFI and its new capabilities they came up with this thing they were too occupied by
 
whether they could to ask if they should they showed it to their bosses they said cool ship it and that's the end of the
 
story but that one's boring and I don't think it's very likely to be honest inside a juggernaut like HP so instead
 
here's some cynicism you can skip it if you like I won't mind there's nothing here to feel good about I have a thesis
 
that I voiced before in various forms that technology as we know it is a phenomenon that happened once upon a
 
time mostly in the 20th century and is now coming to a close the great inventions are invented and an
 
overwhelming proportion of problems as far as consumer products go are solved not everyone can afford those Solutions
 
and many solutions won't get made because they aren't sufficiently profitable these are not in dispute I'm not saying there's nothing left for us
 
to do as a species I'm saying that we're never going to see another Walkman a device so deeply altering what you can
 
do in your day-to-day life that stores can't keep it on the shelves I believe that our culture is so deeply formed
 
around consumer technology that when we run out of new gadgets to buy we won't know what to do with ourselves anymore
 
and this is already happening the basic Loop for over a century went like this you industry invent a vacuum cleaner you
 
then convince a bunch of people hopefully everyone that a vacuum cleaner will make them happy you now make a lot
 
of profit by selling vacuum cleaners oops Market saturation everyone has a
 
vacuum nobody needs a new one they work for a long time and even when they break 's now 30 companies selling equivalent
 
cleaners so why would someone buy another one of yours well to solve this problem you invent a new vacuum with a
 
stronger motor or a quieter motor a bigger hose a better beater less weight Etc you tell everyone the new vacuum
 
cleaner will make them happy again and if you're lucky they all buy yours and not someone else's bam you make a lot of
 
profit well what happens when the perfect vacuum cleaner is discovered the whole theory of capitalism centers
 
around the idea of continuous Improvement but I argue that this has actually happened that vacuums got as
 
good as they could conceivably get decades ago and nobody has any idea how to compete anymore so they're all losing
 
their minds it's reached the point where you can't buy a good vacuum cleaner anymore because they're all so deeply
 
entrenched in the drive to compete in a space where competition is logically impossible that they've trended away
 
from the solved problems this gets worse when you consider the perspective of a company like HP even 20 years ago what
 
did their job look like okay you assemble a thing out of parts that you had nothing to do with an Intel CPU and
 
chipset real Tech audio Nvidia GPU Western Digital hard drive then you convince people that your machine is
 
what the cheapest the most reliable question marks and then
 
hopefully you make profit by selling the exact same thing that your competition does yeah it's it's broken the whole
 
latter part of the loop is missing how does HP convince you that their machine is better when it can't be
 
because HP doesn't make anything they can't make anything their product is metal boxes plastic trim and
 
motherboards everything else they sell is a jelly bean a part that some other company made that all other vendors also
 
have access to CPUs chipsets hard drives LCD screens these all do specific things
 
that need to work exactly the way they all already do nobody wants a round LCD
 
so every screen is identical except in matters of degree resolution brightness color quality size dot pitch Etc but
 
there are no local Maxima possible we know what the best screen for a business
 
machine is and the only difference between a given HP and a given Dell is whether they did or didn't choose the
 
objectively correct part if you buy the machine with the 1366 X 768 display you
 
got something that is simply worse than it could have been the only stuff that HP has editorial input on are the metal
 
boxes the plastic trim and there's really not that much much you can do with those and motherboards are even
 
worse they have to be exactly the same in every machine in existence because they're just plugging together Jelly
 
Bean parts and then it has to run someone else's software so the firmware has to be 100% functionally identical to
 
every other machine this is why motherboard seos setups got those wacky graphical backgrounds and inscrutable
 
controls because it was literally the only thing they were able to make their own so they poured all the mustard they
 
had on it because what else can you do when you're otherwise invisible like at
 
least with laptops they could do stuff with the case right like the elite books have this little pop out LED here that
 
illuminates the keyboard it's absolutely adorable it's delightful and uh IBM had them in like 1999 CU it's a really
 
obvious idea it's like one of the most obvious ideas possible and it's yet another Jelly Bean Part hey you know
 
what else we have white LEDs put those in there somewhere so what's next after
 
that what do you what do you add cuz cuz most people don't really want anything more than a mouse a keyboard a set of speakers and a monitor and everything
 
already has those and they're all very good already if HP could think of something new to add it would just be
 
something you could plug in with USB or Thunderbolt and virtually everything that you can imagine of that sort is
 
already being sold basically the only problems left to solve with the entire category of PCS is minor aspects of
 
convenience how many ports where they are whether they're on the back or the side Etc so
 
imagine being a product designer at HP in the very late 2000s some VP storms in and goes we have to deliver features for
 
executives we're selling them $2,500 notebooks but Dells have all the same ins and outs we need
 
features what do you do well there's only one thing you can do you stare at the guy and you muster up the courage to
 
say Bob we're a motherboard we're a turnkey we're in the middle we don't get
 
to have features our business is selling invisible unnoticeable plinths whose so
 
purpose is to hold up a copy of Microsoft Office and that's the truth the trouble is it's not what Bob wants
 
to hear because he wants a bonus he got hired for a sefian job and he's realizing this he will never be in
 
charge of an important headline feature because there won't ever be one he works for a company that makes widgets Bob is
 
in hell and he's making it your problem so he tells you you're fired and then he turns to the next person and he says the
 
same thing and fires him if need be and he repeats until someone blurts out the dumbest idea they've ever had in a cold
 
panic because Executives run Outlook that's their job the job of a CEO is to
 
send emails and Outlook is how you do that at a job so you can't sell Executives anything I mean what are you
 
going to offer them more RAM Outlook runs fine in four gigs even now and especially then more CPU same answer
 
Outlook runs on a core2 Duo a GPU for what to render graphs there's nothing to
 
sell to a person who could still do their job on a computer from 2004 so
 
when you blurred out uh what if we made Outlook start faster Bob's going to go there you go do that it's it's the
 
poochie episode from The Simpsons it's always been like this but how do you make Outlook faster I mean you can't
 
it's impossible Microsoft controls the whole machine let alone Outlook HP can't stick their fingers in and somehow
 
enhance that experience so they touch the only thing they actually have domain over the pre-boot experience up until
 
when Windows starts HP is still in control their firmware is still executing that's the only crack they
 
could get their fingers into and they were starving does it make sense to write a whole Bare Metal application
 
that runs Raw on the CPU just so an executive doesn't have to wait an extra 10 seconds to read their email of course
 
not they're not going to use it okay they're just going to boot into windows they're going to ignore that button
 
entirely but HP needs a feature because Bob needs a feature so they make one of
 
the only standalone fi applications in history so that department can say that they shipped
 
something and then they're out of ideas we made quasy Outlook it loads in 8 seconds and 6 months later ah Bob
 
needs another bonus we got to do something well um uh well okay we can't make Windows
 
boot faster but can can we run code while it's booting no well we're
 
all out of a job then so someone figure it out and so they did it's the only lever they could pull there were no
 
others so they pulled that one what else do you do when your job your industry has been obsolete for years I mean don't
 
get me wrong there are good Engineers doing good engineering at HP okay maybe you work there designing motherboards
 
terrific someone has to figure out how to plug together the jelly beans it's a hard job but at the end of the day it's
 
the same thing everybody else is doing it's no different than the car industry Hyundai Dodge Honda Toyota they're all
 
employing skilled Engineers to do real work but they're all working on the same problems and they're going to solve them
 
to about the same level of satisfaction except where they've been denied access to the known ideal Solutions due to
 
economics or IP law it's duplicated effort on a good day we don't need dozens of car manufacturers we know how
 
to make good engines sturdy frames and comfortable Upholstery and every company is within a few points of each other
 
except where they're egregiously doing a bad job solely because Bob needs a bonus and can only achieve that by shaking up
 
something that was already fine the way it was middle management has a vested interest in
 
unsolved because individuals profit from creating chaos which can then be made to look like progress and so it is for the
 
dozens of computer companies still in business we don't need this many they all make the same thing except where
--------------------
they've cut Corners in a desperate attempt to compete in a market where competition is definitionally impossible
 
the only actual Innovations come from the people making the silicon and they themselves are unable to cope with the
 
fact that they've saturated the market 10 times over and that by and large people don't really need new computers
 
anymore the industry has stagnated to a shocking degree I have computers from 2016 that I couldn't actually tell you
 
are that old without looking up their components because the parts look the same the software runs the same the
 
increase in speed over the years is negligible for most intents and purposes and most problems have been solved to
 
most people's satisfaction 8 years ago your boot Drive could be a half terabyte of solid state storage and that same
 
drive is still perfectly good today for almost everyone and sure not everyone has a computer that's even as good as a
 
top-of-the-line one from 2016 but it's only due to economics enough computers of that quality were made for
 
everyone yes everyone to have one and they're going in landfills because it's
 
not profitable to get them to the people who would use them and there's nowhere to go next PC technology has rocketed
 
past what the majority of people actually need we're now doing the equivalent of putting 600 horsepower
 
engines in golf carts and there's simply no reason anyone would want or even notice a 700 horsepower upgrade how have
 
corporations not noticed this and what rash decisions will they make once they accept this inevitable truth I don't
 
like thinking about it because I think that this HP thing is a picture of what happened the last time they felt this
 
cornered in my opinion we can expect to see a lot more of this bizarre flailing as time goes on I was actually shocked
 
that all this happened at the specific time that it did really because 2010 was a significantly more interesting era in
 
the history of the PC the UEFI switch over was happening We were finishing the migration to PCI Express USB 3 was
 
becoming commonplace suddenly the average computer could do things that it just couldn't do a year earlier it was a
 
great time to upgrade your PC if you hadn't done so in a few years and a great time to be selling upgraded PCS so
 
it seemed weird that HP would feel the need to produce something this baldly desperate well as it turns
 
out and I only discovered this very late in the script writing process so I figured I'd just leave it until now I I I I think it makes things weightier a
 
quick look is actually a feature from 2007 where it makes way more sense and
 
it actually does make it fit into the series hooray HP was probably still shipping this just because of momentum
 
but it makes a lot more sense as a 2007 feature because Yeah by 2010 HP probably
 
did feel a lot of relief from the doldrums of the late Core 2 era but that relief certainly would have faded later
 
on and at this point I wonder just what their product designers do all day I can't even picture it but anyway that's
