ask olof how easiest to aproach

simple interface centered arround a tumbnail of a youtubevideo

interface buttons 9-0

each button is a drop down list allowing you to pick one of your playlists in youtube right now.

on the side/above/belove the tumbnail of the video could a dragable que be built as you select videos to add and remove fom playlists.

first thing happening is the page explaining what you can do and telling you you have to connect to your youtube account.

secondary you pick which playlist to load entries from.

the tumbnail act as a cursor on the current playlist and you are shown buttons move upp, move down, skipp to next, skipp to previeus.

then also dropdownlists, whom if selected, allows you to also with the help of the numberkeys, move to this playlists, that is copy to, then remove.

will need youtube api, gotta see if youtube has restrictions on numbers of calls, then this is not a good idea.

arround the areias we could have add banners, something like, when no list selected, a banner in it's place, when selecting a list to load and moving content to this list, replace add with the list content.

allow drag and drop between lists if possible after you've made initial moves.
