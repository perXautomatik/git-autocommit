as years pass by, you accumelate more and more digital past

i'd like to vizualise me and my wifes past trough our photo uploads
our emails, and common friends 
so the most obeus way would be to use a calender like google callender
then populate this with images from google photos and or facebook
lastly using sms and email arkives to ilustrate milestones.

aditionally it could be possible to download the social movie rating site, 
Filmtipsets data, where we both rated movies, and it should be possible to asign this to dates in the callendar

next data source would be youtoube likes.
in the beguining of the youtube age, one didn't bing watch videos the way i do today
so it would make way more sence charing this information while it was sparse

the last.fm data could also be parsed into this, the question is if maybe top artisrscould be more relevant
than every loved track

Data source:
  youtube; liked
  filmtipset; rated
  last.fm; topplays/week
  gmail; emails between us
  google photos; photos
  facebook; photos
 
 vizualisation
 banner like callender view
