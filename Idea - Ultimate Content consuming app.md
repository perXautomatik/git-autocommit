add content from each flow by date, and stream sceduals, will trigger on desegnated time. 

a "library" view, 
  where you can see what content you 
  already have consumed and what you are 
  yeat to consume, 
  not like a 
    list, not like 
    tumbnails of thousands of unseen content.
  but instead
    a long draggable list of tumbnails from each flow per chanell, 
    organized like a forest. 
    with indications of 
      what you have seen and 
      not seen, 
      with eather colour or 
      bar.

possibility to 
  continusly add more sources, 
    eather by 
    tag or by 
    url,
  with choises like, 
    auto text synthesis text entries or
    pause before loading next entrie.

with priorety lists, like
if unseen video by graystill plays, first priority, otherwise, continue where we left.

possibility to select a next priority, 
like 
  unseen by, or 
  next unseen by masterlist date, or 
  always alter content source or
  folow theme; sience, humor whatever
  last in first out;
