# Mod planning

Original recepies export 

And import into a mind map
Drag and drop is just what I need

Common ancestor?

If possible make a ingredient a root node
And result into a child node
This will be less efficient if child nodes can't have common ancestors


7days to die mod
	* see total stats from gear as standard window in staits menue, 
	* routs: set up quest sequence, 
		basicly click on quest icons in the map with shift down and they will remind you and move tracker as you complete them instead of pointing back to trader
