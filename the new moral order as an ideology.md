generally it implies 
	a rejection of 
	the traditional values and norms 
		of Western civilization and culture,
	a replacement of them with 
		a progressive, 
		secular, 
		globalist agenda

 is often associated with 
	 movements, such as 
		globalism, 
		climate-change alarmism, 
		cultural self-cancellation, 
		wokeism, 
		social justice, 
		diversity,
		equity, and 
		inclusion
		
they share a common goal of 
	transforming the 
		social, 
		economic
		political structures 
			and relations of the world 
		according to 
			a progressive 
			secular worldview
		
Some political leaders have used the term ‚Äúthe new moral order‚Äù to describe their vision for a more 
	peaceful and cooperative world order, based on 
		human rights, 
		democracy, 
		multilateralism 
	
They see the new moral order as a positive and necessary response to 
	the challenges of the modern era, 
		such as 
			globalization, 
			climate change
			terrorism

some critics 
 see the new moral order 
	 as 
		 a negative dangerous imposition 
			of a radical and elitist ideology, 
		that
			 threatens to erase the
					historical achievements 
					 identities
			of Western nations and peoples
	therefore undermining the foundations of Western civilization and culture, 
	such as 
		Judeo-Christian belief, 
		national sovereignty 
		individual liberty

- By negative and dangerous, they mean that the new moral order has harmful consequences for the well-being and security of Western civilization and culture, and that it poses a threat to their values and interests.
- By imposition, they mean that the new moral order is not a result of a democratic and consensual process, but rather a forced and coercive one, that does not respect the diversity and sovereignty of different nations and peoples .
- By radical, they mean that the new moral order is based on a extreme and revolutionary worldview, that rejects the historical and traditional foundations of Western civilization and culture, such as Judeo-Christian belief, national sovereignty, and individual liberty .
- By elitist, they mean that the new moral order is driven by a powerful and privileged group of people, who have a disproportionate influence and control over the global institutions and media, and who do not represent or care about the common people .
